# Diverse Perspectives PoC

Embracing diverse perspectives nurtures empathy and encourages informed conversations, fostering understanding among individuals. Considering that medias narrow their perspective to target specific audiences and increased polarization leads to decreased economic prosperity, there is a need of finding ways to limit partisan news consumption and facilitate cross-cutting exposure. Without listening there are no agreements.

We propose creating a webpage designed to combat toxic polarization by offering users personalized, balanced, and diverse perspectives on news and current events. When a user reads an article, our tool will utilize text embeddings and information retrieval to identify equivalent articles from opposing viewpoints, such as an article from The New York Times and its counterpart from Fox News covering the same event. Using LLMs like GPT-4, it will generate summaries highlighting the differences and similarities between these articles, including the facts they mention and they omitted. The goal is to enable users to consume information in a less biased manner, encouraging them to break out of their echo chambers.

By presenting contrasting viewpoints, the tool will help users break out of their echo chambers, encouraging them to consider perspectives different from their own. Understanding diverse viewpoints fosters empathy, promoting better communication and understanding among citizens and reducing toxic polarization.

The project is partially founded by [Civic Health Project](https://www.civichealthproject.org/).
