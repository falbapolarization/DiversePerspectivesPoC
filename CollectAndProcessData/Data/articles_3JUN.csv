Labs“所有证据都表明，中国正在为恢复核试验做准备，”卡内基国际和平基金会的核专家赵通说。新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯武器实验室前主任齐格弗里德·赫克说，罗布泊的重建很不寻常。“俄罗斯人和美国人也在继续试验场的活动，”他说，“但跟这是两码事。”分析人士表示，罗布泊的活动标志着中国核设施的广泛现代化。他们警告称，这可能会加速军备建设，引发一个新的核竞争时代。他们还说，中国和其他核大国的举动可能会破坏1996年开始的全球禁试协议。冷战结束后，世界核大国签署了该条约，以遏制代价高昂、逐渐失控的核军备竞赛。关于罗布泊的新证据是由五角大楼下属的国家地理空间情报局的前分析师雷尼·巴比亚尔兹发现的，他是卫星侦察和北京核计划方面的专家，他说，在深井中进行爆炸可能加快对新型核武器的完善，以满足中国快速增长的武器库。查看了卫星图像和巴比亚尔兹的分析报告的独立专家也有同样的担忧。罗布泊的活动正值美中关系最为敏感的时刻。美国总统拜登表示，他正试图“稳定”两国日益不和的关系，并在去年11月与中国领导人习近平举行的峰会上寻求某种程度的和解。美国情报官员表示，多年来他们一直在关注罗布泊的重新启用。他们说，虽然建筑工程很明显，但其目的并不明显。他们承认，中国可能正在为核试验做准备。中国外交部在声明中回应了有关罗布泊升级的问题，称其为“捕风捉影，毫无根据地制造中国核威胁”，称这种说法“完全不负责任”。外交部还强调了北京遵守核试验禁令的承诺，并补充说，这一立场“赢得了国际社会的高度赞扬”。声明说，中国将“不遗余力地实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高愿望”。一个侦探和他的发现前情报分析员巴比亚尔兹的博士论文写的是中国核计划的起源。他现在管理着一家民用卫星图像分析公司的运营部门，同时在约翰·霍普金斯大学教授一门关于地理空间分析的课程，最近还与人合著了一本关于卫星图像解读的教科书。雷尼·巴比亚尔兹在佛蒙特州的家中。 John Tully for The New York Times从政府部门离职后，巴比亚尔兹花了很多时间分析罗布泊的卫星图像。在做评估时，他不仅查看了最新的图像，还翻出早期图像，它们提供了罗布泊基地发展的直观历史。在今年的一份报告中，他详细记录了一个占地约26平方公里的新试验区。巴比亚尔兹说，这片贫瘠的土地上有很深的钻孔，还有新的公路、输电线、一个变电站和一个有多座建筑物的支持区。2021年8月

Maxar“总体迹象表明，他们正在准备进行试验，”他在接受采访时说。罗布泊位于中国西部干旱的新疆地区，是一片广阔的军事基地，面积与弗吉尼亚州相当。按照中国的说法，在这里进行核试验是因为它非常贫瘠，与世隔绝，没有任何常住居民。但其所在的新疆地区是以穆斯林为主的维吾尔族人的家园，近些年他们遭受了大规模的拘禁，以及无处不在的监控。维吾尔族人长期以来一直抗议在这里进行核试验对健康的威胁。1964年，毛泽东决定研发原子弹后，这里开始进行核试验。早期的试验给这里的天空带来蘑菇云和放射性沉降物。1969年，中国进行了首次地下核试验。起初，北京使用的是较浅的平洞。中国相对较晚开始钻凿深度足以可靠抑制致命辐射的竖井，尤其是针对大型的爆炸。1978年，中国进行了首次竖井核试验。毛泽东曾说过原子弹是“纸老虎”的名言。因此，中国建设的核武库曾小于法国和英国核力量的总和。冷战结束后，罗布泊核试验场停止了大型核爆炸试验，变得相对冷清。2012年习近平上台后，这种情况开始改变。这名中国领导人将他在2015年底成立的火箭军视为功绩之一。这支负责管理中国核武器的精锐部队体现了习近平的雄心壮志，他要把中国提升为一个受尊重、令人恐惧的大国，随时准备与美国抗衡。事实证明，习近平的政治崛起与罗布泊的重生是并行的。罗布泊的秘密活动的公开是由于现在有了新的公开监视手段。绕地球运行的最强大的民用成像卫星可以分辨地面上直径小至30厘米的物体。分析人士说，从数百公里高的地方，这种航天器和它携带的望远镜可以辨别出人、车辆类型，甚至飞机的注册编号。巴比亚尔兹对民用图像的分析讲述了一个罗布泊升级换代的故事。到2017年，一处只有几栋建筑的旧址变成了一组漂亮的超现代建筑群，四周修建了防护栏。新建筑包括一个由土堤和避雷器保护的掩体，使其成为处理烈性爆炸物的理想场所。2021年5月

Maxar这处地点引起了怀疑，但情况尚不明朗。核武器使用常规炸药来启动连锁反应。但亚临界核试验也是如此，也就是全球禁止核试验条约允许的规模较小的试验。巴比亚尔兹谨慎地表示，该建筑群可能是准备核装置的场所。到2018年，罗布泊的下一个大项目是一处大型空军基地的快速扩建，它的主跑道近5公里长。卫星图像显示，有十几座大型建筑正在建设中。2021年8月 未完工的跑道 已铺设跑道 主要保障区 第二保障区

Maxar与此同时，特朗普政府在2018年宣布，“美国必须随时做好恢复核试验的准备”。2019年，中国外交部批评美国不仅破坏了核试验禁令，而且破坏了“全球战略安全与稳定”。即便如此，特朗普的高级官员还是在2020年5月讨论了重启核试验的好处。会议消息遭到泄露。不久之后，参议院军事委员会的共和党人批准了1000万美元的拨款，以缩短进行一次核试验所需的时间。随着紧张局势的加剧，巴比亚尔兹发现，中国已经开始改造和扩大罗布泊试验区——最初是这里的平洞。这些相当浅的坑道冷战期间进行过小当量的试爆。2020年的卫星图像显示，一条主坑道正在进行大规模的挖掘和建设工作，其入口被卡车、推土机和挖出的成堆泥土包围。2021年8月

Maxar但与警备严密的地方一样，这些平洞的用途并不明确，这些岩洞的深度足以用来吸收小型原子弹或大型亚临界核试验爆炸的冲击波。但后来意外地出现了更加令人不安的线索。巴比亚尔兹在2021年初仔细观察罗布泊的新卫星图像时注意到了一些大型的修路设备：一台平地机和一台前端装载机。“它们出现在荒无人烟的地方，”他回忆道。2021年4月 新铺整型土路 前端装载机 可能是平地机 2021年4月 新铺整型土路

Maxar巴比亚尔兹顺着这条新路查看下去。这条路长约十几公里，从一片数十年前用于竖井爆炸的平坦地带延伸至一处正在快速发展的山区。在一片迷宫般的峡谷中，他惊讶地发现了一座正在架设的大型钻机。该钻机高约27米。那是2021年7月。次月，他在新获得的图像中不仅看到了钻机井架，还看到了大量的钻杆和旁边的一个润滑剂深坑，钻头往更深处钻洞时需要润滑剂。巴比亚尔兹从这些线索估计出，钻出的洞深至少有500米。2021年8月

Maxar相比之下，美国政府在内华达试验场的竖井最大深度是760米左右。因此，中国钻的洞的估计深度似乎没有超过美国的最大洞深。与罗布泊试验区的平坦地势不同，新试验区的多岩地形为大型装备提供了高隐蔽性。尽管如此，巴比亚尔兹还是在去年发现了第二处钻点。“藏在丘陵地带的更深处，”他说，而且钻机的支承装置已被小心翼翼地遮盖起来。2022年8月 通路 中型钻机 约15米高 遮挡的保障区 可能是堆放的钻杆

Maxar对原子弹专家来说，这些深洞似乎是为容纳大型核试验设计的。“我们从未在竖井中做过亚临界试验，”内华达试验场的前钻井作业负责人帕特里克·罗威说。“这么做不明智，因为钻洞的成本太高了。”钻机的意外发现促使巴比亚尔兹扩大了观察范围。最近，他把全部注意力集中到了一个庞大的保障基地。通过查看该基地的历史图像，他发现，基地的30多栋建筑或是经过了重大翻修，或是新建的。2023年10月

Maxar“主要的是，那里相当忙，”巴比亚尔兹在谈到该军事基地时说。咄咄逼人和边缘政策核武器专家说，他们没有看到中国即将进行核试验的迹象，并提出理由说中国也许不做什么。重建军事基地可能只是向西方发出的一种警告，他们说。中国的专家们已发表过类似的看法。习近平已在2023年7月更换了火箭军的最高层将领。 Li Gang/Xinhua中国是否进行核试验可能也取决于其对手的行动。俄罗斯最近发出的信号、以及美国政府早些时候发出的信号也许会让中国政府担忧。经常访问中国并与中国最好的科学家保持交流的著名核物理学家理查德·L·加尔文说，重建罗布泊试验场代表着一种技术上的下注。“他们不想在别人走在前面时毫无准备，”他说。卡内基基金会的专家赵通同意这个说法：“中国觉得有必要为最坏的情况做准备。”桑迪亚国家实验室前主任斯蒂芬·M·杨格说，中国单方面进行核试验，以此来表明态度，并非不可想象之事。一些分析人士认为，中国也许没进行大型核爆的计划，而是在逐步增加本国的亚临界试验项目，这种试验不会产生自持链式反应。俄罗斯和美国都用这类试验来评估本国的现有核武库。有些专家不同意这个观点，他们认为中国新增的轰炸机、潜艇和导弹发射井都预示着中国将大力发展新军备。五角大楼已预测，按照中国目前的军力扩张速度，到2035年时，中国将有部署1500枚核弹头的能力。这个数字将让中国半个多世纪以来保持的“最小威慑”增加五倍。美国专家说，中国科学家目前正计划研发在他们看来是最适于这轮军备扩张的具体武器，并可能从核试验中学到很多东西。中国与美俄不同，后者在“冷战”期间进行过规模远大于中国的核试验。“我知道他们认为他们落在了后面，”洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室前主任特里·C·华莱士说，他长期从事对中国核试验计划的研究。“他们也许觉得他们在核试验知识上太落后，因此想采取非同寻常之举。”风险与回报的问题核试验让科学家能找到缺陷，从而改进新武器的设计。中国在“冷战”期间总共进行了45次核爆炸试验。相比之下，法国进行了210次，俄罗斯进行了715次，美国进行了1030次。虽然已有187个国家签署了禁止核试验条约，但由于中国、美国和其他六个国家没有批准，该条约从未生效。尽管如此，分析人士长期以来一直认为该条约有利于美国，因为它禁止与美国竞争的遵守条约国家提高自己核武库的先进性。专家们说，中国最想实现的是核武器小型化。有了能更准确地打击目标的新型导弹，科学家们能降低核弹头的爆炸当量、大小和成本。“他们有完全能用的核武器，”加尔文说，他在设计世界上第一颗氢弹上有功劳。“但他们可能想把武器小型化。”专家们说，核武器小型化能让中国的潜射导弹更具杀伤力。据外界判断，中国的潜射导弹最多可携带三枚核弹头。相比之下，美国的主要潜射导弹“三叉戟II型”最多可携带八个弹头。核武器小型化还能推动中国高超音速武器的研发，这种武器能迂回避开美国的防御系统。据五角大楼的说法，中国想让这些武器拥有核优势。去年秋天，全球公民社会的领导人曾警告说，禁止核试验条约面临着“日益严重的威胁”，并提出了加强禁止核试验条约的办法。中国官员迅速否认了所有核试验的计划，同时以更快的速度将矛头指向美国。“如果真正关心”禁止核试验条约的话，中国外交部在一份声明中说，就该“好好研究一下美国的核武库和核政策”。例如，中国的专家批评美国双重标准，一边支持全球禁止核试验，一边想方设法研发能够规避禁令的技术。2022年，美国科学家们宣布了在核聚变实验上取得的一项被称赞为向丰富清洁能源迈出了一步的重大进展。消息公布后的第二天，中共的民族主义小报《环球时报》专门提到该核聚变实验使用的巨型激光的一个鲜为人知的事实：它主要用于推动核武器发展。中国已在近来指出，美国自“冷战”以来设计的第一个新型核弹头W93目前正在研发中，这是美国核扩张的例证。美国军方说，这个创新武器不需要进行爆炸试验。尽管如此，中国的专家们仍把重启核试验的威胁描述为来自美国。去年9月，解放军退役军官腾建群在中国央视军事频道的一期节目中称，美国“试图突破核试验限制”。相比之下，美国的专家们则将罗布泊设施的现代化工程视为中国也许愿意在核武器项目上走多远的一个标志。“我们不得不认识到，他们曾经采取的保守立场正在改变，”洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室前主任华莱士说。;Left

online scam compound in Myanmar. 尼奥·陆（音）对这份报酬丰厚的新工作充满期待。但是从抵达那一刻起，他就知道事情有蹊跷。 他没有被聘用。他是被绑架了，被迫参与恶劣的网络诈骗活动。只有理解了它的运转方式，才有希望逃脱出来。 在缅甸“杀猪盘”诈骗园区的七个月 一名男子被中国犯罪团伙拐卖并被迫在一个诈骗组织工作。他收集了财务信息、照片和视频，并与《纽约时报》分享了这些材料。他被许以丰厚的薪酬。更合理的工作时间安排。有机会在繁华大都市曼谷生活。招聘机构说，以他的英语能力，可以作为译员在一家电商公司大展拳脚。尤其重要的是，这位28岁的中国上班族相信，这份工作让他可以从头开始，为他移居西方的梦想攒钱。于是他在去年6月与身边的人道别，前往泰国从事他的新工作。然而抵达后，烈日照得他头昏脑涨——他感觉事情很不对劲。他没有来到城市里的写字楼，而是被丢在一个劳改营一样的地方，那是丛林和泥泞田地间的一些简易建筑。园区内很简陋，低矮的水泥房子上，门窗全都有栅栏。入口有两个穿迷彩服的男人手持步枪站岗。高高的围墙和篱笆顶端有铁丝网，显然除了防止外人闯入外，也是为了让里面的人出不去。园区的景象。尼奥·陆很快意识到，这其实不是一份翻译的工作。也不存在什么电商公司。这一切，从某中国招聘论坛上的贴文开始，都是人贩子精心布下的骗局，目的是把他这样的人骗到泰国。人贩子带着尼奥·陆渡过了莫伊河——那是形同虚设的泰国边境线上的一条混浊的河流——在他不知情的情况下把他弄到了缅甸的一个偏僻角落。在那里，他被交给出钱买下他的一个华人黑帮。尼奥·陆等于是被诱拐到了一个他完全陌生的地方，并卖给了犯罪团伙。他就这样成了被拐卖给犯罪团伙的数十万人中的一员，他们被困在这个充斥着剥削、暴力和欺诈的陷阱中无法脱身，一个研究组织称之为“犯罪肿瘤”。由于担心被犯罪分子报复，尼奥·陆选择电影《黑客帝国》(Matrix)中的人物作为自己的化名，他要求只在文中使用他的姓氏。通过采访他的父母和两个朋友，以及查阅短信、旅行文件副本和中国当局发布的信函，时报对他旅行、被囚禁和最终获救的情节进行了核实。他讲述的拐卖过程与其他在类似园区获救的人做出的陈述是相符的。他的经历以及他带出来的资料让我们有了一个难得的机会，可以从中了解到一个极其庞大的地下世界的运转方式和策略。这些团伙在柬埔寨、老挝和缅甸的基地强迫被他们囚禁的人去实施复杂的网络诈骗，其目标是世界各地的一些感到孤单、容易上当的人。通常这类骗术会使用虚假的网络身份，以引诱他人建立虚假的恋爱关系，然后通过伪造的加密货币骗局向他们骗取大量金钱。这样的骗术被称为“杀猪盘”，因为整个过程需要骗取目标的信任，这可能需要数周的时间——也就是所谓把猪养肥——然后才下杀手。很多被诱拐和强迫为诈骗团伙工作的是中国人，因为这些团伙一开始主要是骗在中国的人。不过他们的目标已经开始广布于世界各地。在美国，联邦调查局的报告称2022年美国人因“杀猪盘”及其它投资骗局导致的损失超过20亿美元。越来越多来自印度、菲律宾及其它十多个国家的人被拐卖并为诈骗团伙工作，以至于国际刑警组织宣布这个趋势构成了全球安全威胁。为了让被拐来的人就范，犯罪团伙会使用暴力和歪曲逻辑兼有的方式。那些不听话的人会遭到殴打。一旦开始做事，这些受害人往往会觉得他们已经成了从犯，如果回国就会坐牢。团伙往往会没收被拐卖者的护照，让他们的签证过期，从而制造移民方面的麻烦。尼奥·陆所在的团伙会把获得的利润分一小部分给工人，用于食物、赌博、毒品和性方面的开销，从而让恶劣的工作环境显得能忍受一些。有的团伙还会给奖励，有时候是加钱，有时候是许诺提供离开所需的旅行证件。“诈骗团伙需要让被拐卖的人有个幻觉，就是靠着努力工作可以离开这个系统，”陆说。“驴子原来是为了不被鞭子抽而向前走，最终会变成追逐在眼前晃的胡萝卜。”陆说他请求他们放了他，但遭到拒绝。他们让他做会计工作，几个月下来，他经手了数百万美元的非法收入，并管理他们的日常开销。尼奥·陆在给诈骗团伙当会计期间制作的一份电子表格，记录了2022年11月的开支和诈骗收入。陆在与《纽约时报》取得联系时还在园区内。他发出了数百页计的财务记录，以及园区的照片和视频，希望有朝一日能揭露这些罪行。他还发了一张地图的截图，标明了他在缅甸的大致位置。时报对该地区卫星图片进行分析，确定了他照片所在位置是一处已知的诈骗团伙园区，名叫东美园区。但到了1月，他失去了音讯。抵达“小中国”缅甸东南部的妙瓦底，也就是东美园区的所在地，为诱拐尼奥·陆的这类诈骗组织提供了完美的基地。政府在这里什么也做不了。暴徒们花钱雇人保护自己，在当地少数民族武装团体的支持下横行霸道。这样的条件吸引了中国犯罪团伙，导致非法赌场飞地纷纷涌现，贩毒和洗钱活动激增。尼泊尔

Technologies在某些方面，东美区让他觉得很像一家中国工厂。工人们可以使用一家食堂、一家出售中国产品的便利店、一家中餐馆、一家名为“金马”的小赌场和一家卡拉OK吧。但它显然是围绕非法活动组织起来的。尼奥·陆说，冰毒、MDMA（又称摇头丸）和氯胺酮可以在游戏厅和卡拉OK厅买到，建筑群里一栋类似宿舍的建筑还兼做妓院。安保很严密，尤其是在园区周边。守卫在瞭望塔和大门口防止工人逃跑。莫伊河环绕着东美大部分地区。水泥墙 铁丝围栏 水泥墙 铁丝围栏 从尼奥·陆的窗户往外看，他住在诈骗组织租用的一栋大楼里。该组织的负责人是一位头发花白、眼睛鼓鼓的中年中国男子，大家都叫他“喜哥”。园区里没有人使用真名。尼奥·陆说，喜哥向东美园区租了这个地方，经营着大约有70人的生意，这些人当中，大多数是同样受困在妙瓦底的中国公民。尼奥·陆后来被告知，为了买他，喜哥向人贩子支付了3万美元。“杀猪盘”运作结构 员工

四名员工由于目标大多在中国，该组织将所有时钟调快一个半小时，以与北京时间保持一致。每天都显得漫长而艰苦：工作从上午10点半开始，到午夜结束，中间有三次休息，每次只休息半小时。工人们每个月只休息一天。他们坐在一间开放式的办公室里，受到主管们的严密监视。在一个房间里，工作人员使用排列在墙上的数百部手机，在中国流行的聊天应用微信上建立看似真实的个人档案。把窃取而来、通常是在网上批发购买的微信账号、手机号码、照片和视频等数据输入这些个人档案。这些工人每天都在使用微信，在每台设备上浏览社交媒体动态，模仿正常使用，以躲过应用程序的欺诈检测系统。尼奥·陆秘密拍摄的诈骗活动使用的账户农场、主要办公空间和部分空置的宿舍。尼奥·陆睡的房间里到处都是蠼螋，散发着恶臭，他和另外七名中国男子住在一起。躺在床上时，尼奥·陆会想，他怎么会偏离了自己曾经设想的生活。17岁时，他曾在英国的一所大学学习了一年工程学，但是因为学费太高，他在中国东部做小生意的父母不得不让他退学。他的情绪开始抑郁，进而变得焦躁不安。从那以后的几年里，他在阿曼、尼日利亚和肯尼亚的中国公司工作，但他渴望存到足够的钱供自己上大学，并且最终移居西方。在他看来，正是这个他一心想实现的愿景让他来到了缅甸。现在，他在一心想着如何逃脱。他知道自己需要帮助，但在到达园区时，他的手机就已经被主管没收了。在第一周，他用工作电话联系了一位使用即时通讯应用Telegram的朋友。第二天，主管们与他对质，威胁要打他，或者把他卖到妙瓦底的另一个营地，据说那里会摘取被贩卖工人的器官。尼奥·陆崩溃了，求他们放了他。“我干不了。我不是这块料。你们放我走吧！”他回忆自己当时对绑架他的人这么说。但是完全没有用。喜哥最后给了尼奥·陆三个选择：支付3万美元的赎金；像其他人一样当骗子；或者把他的技能派上用场，帮喜哥做会计。喜哥说，六个月后，黑帮会考虑释放他。尼奥·陆选择了会计。尼奥·陆将电费、办公室租金和佣金等费用记入账目。但他追踪到的其他款项是犯罪行业独有的。“茶水费”指的是支付给中间人的钱，让他们与人贩子联系。“过河费”包括偷运工人越过边境的费用。“派兵费”是支付给武装警卫护送人们进出营地的费用。“车队费”是指用于洗钱的资金。骗术如何操作喜哥团伙欺骗的主要是年龄在30岁到50岁之间、说中文的女性，最好已婚。一个小组主管负责批量购买个人数据，从中确定可能的受害者。另一个小组主动用微信向潜在目标发出加好友的请求和消息。目标接受了添加请求后，工人们就按照一个事先写好的剧本操作，据尼奥·陆的描述，骗术过程是这样的：“杀猪”之前

开对话喜哥的团伙之所以以已婚女性为目标，是因为她们出于对名誉的担心，会竭尽全力避免向家人求助或报警，尼奥·陆说。骗钱的速度快到令尼奥·陆惊讶。据他保留下来的记录，在去年7月至11月的五个月里，该团伙从214名受害者那里弄到了相当于440多万美元的钱。尼奥·陆保留下来的文档中还包括一些受害者的联系电话。时报给十几名被该团伙诈骗的女性打了电话。一名要求不具名的女性说，她去年11月被骗走了10.8万元。另一名只说自己姓易（音）的女性说，她去年8月被骗走了25.2万元，其中包括她借来的钱，她现在仍在努力还钱。拥有微信的互联网巨头腾讯在一份声明中表示，公司禁止在该平台上从事犯罪行为，并致力于打击诈骗。腾讯还敦促用户提高警惕。惩罚和监禁为团伙工作了近六个月后，尼奥·陆赢得了绑架者的信任，他们允许他每天用几分钟的私人手机。他与家人和朋友们取得联系，告诉他们自己被绑架了。他拍摄了园区的照片，还在团伙的主要办公室里面拍摄了短视频，同时想方设法不引起注意。他绘制了团伙的组织结构图，还编制了一个行业术语表。他把所有这些文件上传到一个加密的电子邮件帐号，并将其从他工作用的设备上删除。然后，他将这些材料、他保留下来的去年7月到11月的财务记录，以及一份包括诈骗受害者的真实姓名、财务往来记录和电话号码的清单发给了时报。今年1月3日，尼奥·陆哀求喜哥信守承诺，放掉他。他非但没有获得自由，反而被带进一间专门用来惩罚不听话的工人的宿舍。尼奥·陆被铐在一个双层床上，只有吃饭和上厕所时才能下来。一名看守对他全程监控。尼奥·陆的电子设备被没收。他告诉绑架他的人，他已向媒体和朋友求救。“我是想让他们明白，我已经把自己和他们都逼入绝境，”他回忆道。“他们不能再信任我，或将我转卖给另一个团伙。我是一颗定时炸弹。”折磨是那个时候开始的。一名负责园区后勤工作的男子扇他的嘴巴，并对他拳打脚踢，他只知道此人叫阿宏。阿宏用一根空心PVC管打他，用电棍电击他。尼奥·陆疼痛难忍。阿宏告诉他，他会继续受惩罚，直到他不再提出要走。在殴打间隙，团伙的头头们轮流出面劝说尼奥·陆放弃离开的念头。他们许诺让他领导一个专门针对说英语的受害者的新部门，在这个职位上他能赚更多的钱。尼奥·陆拒绝了，并说他的家人会支付赎金。一天，阿宏进到屋里，用一条灰色围巾把脸遮起来。他在屋子里架起了摄像机，一群人聚集在旁边观看。按下“录制”键后，他拿起了电棍。他是在录制勒索视频。尼奥·陆在中国的父母收到的勒索视频的截图。1月14日，在距离尼奥·陆3000多公里远的中国台州，他父母的手机亮了起来。犯罪团伙给他们发来了两段视频。视频中可以看到，尼奥·陆盘腿坐在两个双层床之间的地上，双手被反铐在背后。一名站在旁边的男子对他挥舞着电棍，电棍触击到他身子时的强烈电流引发出刺耳的噼啪声，还伴有蓝色的火花。持电棍者先是触击尼奥·陆的右膝，然后是左膝、腹部和背部。在一段视频中，尼奥·陆疼得在地上打滚，痛苦地嚎叫着。对他的父母来说，这些视频难以承受。“我老公不让我看，他看了，”尼奥·陆的母亲彭女士说，她要求记者不使用她的全名。“我是受不了。”救援该团伙索要的赎金是50万元人民币。尼奥·陆的父母经营的是横幅和LED标牌的小生意，对他们来说，那是一笔不小的钱。彭女士回短信给喜哥，提出需要更多的时间和信息。他们应该怎样支付赎金？把钱转给谁？她补充问道：“让我们人再看一眼……确认一下。”尼奥·陆的父母报了警，并向中国大使馆和商业协会寻求帮助。他们还祈求了更高一层的力量：每天清晨，彭女士和丈夫都会去海边为儿子的平安归来祈祷。后来，他们家所在的浙江省的警方给他们介绍了一名他们说能提供帮助的男子。这个绰号叫“Dragon”的人说，他已成功地将200多名中国公民从东南亚诈骗团伙手中救了出来。他还用博客记录了这些经历。Dragon打电话给尼奥·陆的父母，向他们讲述了接下来可能发生的令人恐惧的细节。他说，绑架者会继续给他们发恐怖的图片和视频。但如果他们支付赎金的话，勒索会没完没了地继续下去。他说，他们该做的是拖延，并表现出愿意配合。他会另找办法。1月21日，也就是收到勒索视频一周后，Dragon告诉尼奥·陆的父母，他有一位有权有势的朋友，是一名与当地武装民兵有联系的中国商人，此人已在当天早些时候去了东美园区，证实了尼奥·陆确在那里。Dragon说，这名朋友两天内就能把尼奥·陆救出来。彭女士给了时报Dragon的联系方式，后者证实了事情的时间线，并笼统地描述了救人过程。Dragon要求匿名，并拒绝提供具体细节，因为担心将事情公开会危及未来的救援。Dragon说，那名人脉广泛的中国商人已在1月23日再次前往东美，这次是在一名将军和缅甸边防部队数十名携带武器的士兵陪同下（边防部队是一个曾支持统治缅甸的军政府的当地武装组织）。这名商人指名说要尼奥·陆。专家们说，当地的民兵组织通常与这些园区的业主们保持关系，但在需要的时候也对在园区内活动的犯罪团伙进行控制。Dragon说，喜哥发的尼奥·陆受折磨的视频已引起了中国当局的注意，这就越界了。Dragon说，这让他的生意伙伴（也就是那名商人）能让将军出面处理尼奥·陆的事情。时报无法独立核实救援细节。尼奥·陆在那间屋子里总共被关了18天，他对谈判一无所知。一天，他突然被通知换衣服，然后上了一辆高尔夫球车。就这样，尼奥·陆被放出来了。他说，当地民兵对他进行了讯问，拿走了他的手机、笔记本电脑、身份证件和现金。几天后，他回到了中国。他乘坐的航班在2月2日抵达了上海。母亲为他准备了一件厚厚的冬衣，因为她知道从东南亚回来的儿子穿的衣服不御寒。看到儿子从到达区出来后，她如释重负。尼奥·陆拥抱了父母，他们都禁不住流下了眼泪。虽然家人避免了向犯罪团伙支付赎金，但彭女士说，她已把25万元转给了Dragon。Dragon说这笔钱是给他的朋友和那名将军的，以感谢他们的帮助。回国的第二天，尼奥·陆找到中国警方，把他收集的所有材料交给了他们，并详细描述了他所知道的诈骗过程。时报看到的一份警方通报称，当局已帮助将尼奥·陆从缅甸的一个电信诈骗园区救出来，通报还说尼奥·陆“之前并未从事网络赌博，电信诈骗等活动”。近几个月来，中国当局已与东南亚国家的官员采取联合行动，逮捕了数千名被指控参与电信诈骗犯罪团伙的中国人，并已将他们遣返回国，但专家们认为，许多犯罪团伙只是将业务转移到了其他地方。尼奥·陆记得，一名绑架者告诉他出去后要保持缄默。但尼奥·陆另有打算。他已接受了中国媒体的采访，为一个电影项目提供了咨询，并打算写一本回忆录。“我想让全世界知道，这些中国人犯罪团伙正在进行的是一种现代奴隶制，”他说。;Left

Blue for The New York Times影响着世界半数人口的一个人生阶段的教育在医学院仍然被严重忽视。2017年对全国住院医生进行的一项调查发现，20%的人没有上过任何关于更年期主题的课程，三分之一的受访者表示，他们不会对有症状的女性采用激素疗法，即使患者没有明确会增加这样做的风险的身体状况。“几年前，当我女儿正在准备医护资格考试时，我问了她这个问题，无论出题的人是谁，答案都不会是‘给她们激素’，”桑托罗说。近年来，事情获得了一些进展：宾夕法尼亚大学建立了更年期诊所，约翰·霍普金斯大学现在为学生提供课堂教学和实践机会。但在妇科领域仍然会有许多人从医学院毕业时没有这方面的准备，无法向需要帮助的更年期女性给出建议，这一点未来几十年恐怕都不会改变。我去看妇科医生时 完全不知道这些。我只知道朋友们告诉我的那些，以及激素疗法是一种选择。那是我第二次与那位妇科医生会面，她给我的印象是时髦、专业、有些匆忙——这并不令人意外，因为她隶属于一家大型医疗集团，那种让人觉得宁愿死于任何让你不舒服的东西、也不愿拨打他们的自动应答电话的公司。我们的会面节奏很快，没有频繁的眼神交流，这让我在提出自己的担忧前犹豫不决：我觉得自己在发牢骚，甚至是不合时宜。但我还是坚持了下来。我告诉她，我有潮热，虽然不是经常性的，但已经足够让我感到困扰。而在所有问题中记忆问题是最困扰我的，所以我接着提出了这个问题。“但这也可能只是正常的衰老，”她说。她停顿了一下，略带怀疑地看了我一眼。“我们只针对明显的症状开激素处方。”她告诉我。我感到被拒绝了，谈话看起来如此之快就结束了也令我很吃惊。我开始怀疑自己。我的症状算“明显”吗？根据什么来定义呢？女性本应在更年期感觉到对自己的身体有了最大的控制权，我们至少终于可以摆脱被迫意外怀孕的风险了。然而，对许多女性来说，更年期成为了一场新的控制我们身体的斗争，这不是因为立法或宗教，而是因为我们和医生都缺乏相关知识。更年期不仅是人生的一个新阶段，也是一种困惑的状态。在我们有权感到自己经验丰富的时候，女性却被迫成为了一个新手，更糟的是还要承担起一个医学侦探的角色，负责解决我们自己的问题。即使是我认识的最为聪慧的那些女性——当你急需又快又好地完成某件事情时你会打电话给她们的那种人——也说自己对人生的这一阶段感到“困惑”。最近的一项全国性调查发现，35%的更年期女性表示她们出现过四种或四种以上的症状，但只有44%的人表示她们曾与医生讨论过自己的症状。更年期女性在主动与医生谈及这些时往往会感到尴尬，她们甚至可能不认为自己的症状是更年期症状。“关于更年期的公关宣传是全宇宙历史上最糟糕的，因为它不仅仅是潮热和盗汗，”乔治敦大学性健康专家兼泌尿科临床助理教授蕾切尔·鲁宾说，“一位56岁的女性来找我，说‘哦，是的，我没有潮热和盗汗，但我有抑郁症和骨质疏松症、性欲低下而且在性生活中感到疼痛。这样的情况发生过多少次了？这些都可能是更年期症状。”鲁宾说，在一个理想的世界里，更多的妇科医生、内科医生和泌尿科医生会与他们的中年病人一起拿着荷尔蒙症状列表逐项讨论，而不是等着看这些女性是否有知识和能力自己提出这些症状。WHI试验评估了最严重的、威胁生命的结果：乳腺癌、心脏病、中风和血栓等。但是，对于那些持续脱发、关节疼痛、突然发现自己的体味发生了变化（而且不是向好的方面变化）、抑郁或感到疲惫的女性来说，服用激素的净益处和日常生活质量的提高可能值得她们面对激素治疗带来的任何风险，即使她们已经过了60岁。即使对于像我这样症状不明显但风险较低的女性来说，服用激素也是有意义的。“我并不是说每个女性都需要激素，”鲁宾说，“但我坚信这是你自己的身体，你自己的选择。”关于更年期的讨论缺乏很多东西，其中之一是在帮助我们做选择时所使用的语言。有些女性在成为母亲的过程中事事顺心，但也有一些女性分娩后忍受着极度的焦虑和抑郁，这就是产后抑郁症。有些女性每个月都会来月经，不会出现大的波动；有些女性则会出现情绪变化，扰乱日常工作，患上我们所说的经前综合征(PMS)，严重的还会患上经前焦虑症。有相当一部分女性在进入更年期时没有任何症状。一些人则遭受了近乎全身性的崩溃，出现脑雾、反复潮热和疲惫。还有一些人能够感受到自己身上发生的变化，并且清楚地知道自己不喜欢这样，但她们并非失去了行为能力。更年期这个宽泛的术语过于庞大，要素过于繁多，造成了一种混乱，让谈论它变得尤其困难。与更年期最密切相关的症状莫过于潮热，这种现象常常被简化为一种喜剧套路——中年妇女疯狂地对着脸扇扇子，往衣服里塞冰块。70%到80%的女性都会有潮热现象，但研究人员几乎和经历潮热的女性一样对它知之甚少。这反映出我们对更年期生物学还有多少需要了解的地方。科学家们现在正试图弄清，潮热仅仅是一种症状还是会引发身体的其他变化。奇怪的是，女性体内灼热的感觉并没有反映在核心体温的明显升高上。潮热源于下丘脑，这是大脑中一个富含雌激素受体的区域，在生殖周期中起着至关重要的作用，同时也起着恒温器的作用。由于缺乏雌激素，下丘脑的恒温器现在变得不正常，它更容易将核心体温的微小升高误认为是太热了，从而引发大量出汗和血管广泛扩张，试图给身体降温。这也会使皮肤温度升高。有些女性一天会出现一次这种情况，有些则会出现10次或更多次，每次持续几秒钟到五分钟不等。女性经历这些症状的时间为七到10年。除了对女性生活质量的影响之外，这些症状是否也预示着危害？2016年，瑟斯顿在学术期刊《中风》(Stroke)上发表的一项研究表明，潮热次数较多（每天至少四次）的女性往往有更多心血管疾病的迹象。这种联系甚至强于心血管风险与肥胖或高血压之间的联系。“我们不知道这是否是因果关系，”瑟斯顿告诫说，“也不知道是向哪个方向发展。我们需要更多的研究。”瑟斯顿告诉我，甚至可能有些女性会因为潮热而加快身体的衰老，有些则不会。她说，至少，关于严重和频繁潮热的报告应该提醒医生更密切地关注女性的心脏健康。瑟斯顿试图确定潮热对血管健康的影响，伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的精神病学教授宝琳·马基则正在建立潮热与更年期轻微认知变化之间的联系。马基已经发现，女性潮热的次数与记忆力之间存在明显的相关性。马基和瑟斯顿想知道，他们是否能在大脑中检测到这种关联的某种物理表现。他们着手进行的研究发现，女性在睡眠中潮热的次数与脑部微小血管受损的迹象之间存在很强的相关性。在匹兹堡的一个实验室里，瑟斯顿向我展示了一幅大脑图像，图像上的微小病变表现为白点，像幽灵一样消失在扫描仪上。她说，这些病变的数量和位置在潮热次数多的女性中都有所不同。但究竟是潮热导致了损害，还是脑血管的变化导致了潮热，她也无法确定。约20%的女性在围绝经期和更年期的最初几年会出现认知能力下降，主要是在语言学习、获取和总结新信息方面。但这种下降的机制是多种多样的。随着雌激素水平下降，同语言学习相关的大脑区域被认为会招募其他区域来支持其运作。在这段过渡时期，大脑正在形成新的通路，这或许可以解释一些女性所经历的认知能力下降。对她们中的大多数人来说，这只是短暂的神经混乱。威尔康奈尔医学院神经学副教授兼女性大脑研究中心主任丽莎·莫斯科尼表示，大多数女性的灰质（处理信息的细胞）体积在稳定之前似乎也会缩小。她把大脑在这些过渡时期经历的过程比作一种“重塑”。但是，瑟斯顿和马基检测到的微小脑损伤并没有消除，它们依然存在，在多年时间里逐渐增加了认知能力下降和失智症的风险。过去15年中，有四项随机对照试验发现，服用雌激素对认知能力没有影响。但马基指出，这四项研究并没有专门针对中度到重度潮热的女性。她认为这可能是关键因素：马基推断，如果使用雌激素治疗潮热，研究人员可能会发现认知健康有所改善。在马基进行的一项小型试验中，约有36名女性都有中度至重度潮热，其中一半人接受了一种能减轻潮热的麻醉治疗，另一半人则接受了安慰剂治疗。她测量了两组人在治疗前和治疗后三个月的认知功能，发现随着潮热的改善，记忆力也得到了提高。她说，这项试验的规模很小，但它“带来了假设”。即使考虑到女性寿命更长的因素，阿尔茨海默病在女性中的发病率也高于男性，这是大脑健康方面的众多差异之一，研究人员因此开始思考雌激素（可能还有激素疗法）在认知能力衰退过程中可能扮演的角色。但迄今为止，有关荷尔蒙疗法和阿尔茨海默病的研究尚无定论。关于荷尔蒙和大脑的现有研究都集中在更年期女性身上，这意味着目前还无法知道围绝经期女性在认知功能暂时下降期间是否可以从服用雌激素和孕激素中获益。“还没有一项针对围绝经期女性的激素疗法随机试验，”马基说，“这太糟糕了，对吧？”瑟斯顿说，同样还不清楚的是，更年期的各种认知变化现象——暂时性的倒退、高遗传风险女性的阿尔茨海默氏症发展，以及小血管脑部疾病标志物的出现——是如何相互作用或相互反映的。瑟斯顿说：“我们还没有对女性进行足够长时间的跟踪研究，因此还无从得知。”她认为，更年期保健的起点和终点都需要一句关键的名言：“我们需要更多的研究”。Marta Blue for The New York Times在信息存在空白的情况下，一个庞大的更年期保健产业应运而生，产品琳琅满目，但福比恩认为这些产品大多只是 “洗剂和药液”。但市场上也出现了一批新的公司，提供经FDA批准的治疗，包括激素疗法。Midi Health提供虚拟的面对面服务，由经过更年期治疗培训的医生和执业护士开具激素处方，一些保险机构也会承保这些药物；Evernow和Alloy等网站直接向患者出售药物。（马基是Midi和Alloy的医学顾问委员会成员）。在Alloy网站上，女性回答一系列有关其症状、家庭和病史的问题，公司的算法就会推荐（或不推荐）处方。开处方的医生会审查病例，并通过短信或电话回答问题，如果女性决定完成订单，只要处方有效，她就可以通过短信与开处方的医生联系。Alloy举办在线支持小组活动，明显来自不同社会经济背景的女性经常在小组中倾诉——她们如何艰难寻找解脱的方法，她们仍在忍受多么大的痛苦，在承受痛苦而寻求帮助时，他人的缺乏同情和关心如何让她们依然饱受创伤。7月，一位中年女性在电话中描述了严重的阴道干涩症状。“走路或者想锻炼的时候，我都会觉得非常痛苦，”她说。“光是动一动都很疼”。她试图购买雌二醇阴道乳膏，这是一种风险极低的药物，用来治疗泌尿生殖系统综合征；她说，她所在的小镇上，这种药品非常短缺。在偶然发现Alloy之前，她一直依靠抗菌药膏来缓解疼痛。这个空间显然是一个没有人来品头评足的地方，女人们可以在这里谈论她们对激素治疗风险收益的个人感受。在一次小组讨论中，一名女性说，她一直在接受激素治疗，这在围绝经期“改变了我的生活”，但她和她的姐妹们同期的乳房X光检查结果让她们感到担忧。她的一位姐妹被诊断为乳腺癌，并切除了淋巴结；而她被诊断为非典型增生，虽然不是癌症，但被认为是一种使女性处于高风险之中的前兆。NAMS指南并没有表示激素疗法是乳腺癌高危女性的禁忌，而是让女人和她们的医生来决定是否接受这种疗法。这名女性说：“我新的妇科医生和癌症医生都不让我使用激素。”她转而从Alloy购买了激素。所以，我现在有点偷偷摸摸的。”讨论会上没有人质疑这名女性违背两位医生建议的决定。我向福比恩提到了这个例子。她说：“在我看来，她觉得医生没有聆听她的想法，所以只好去别的地方求助。”福比恩告诉我，在某些情况下，充分了解风险但出现可怕症状的高风险女性可能会合理地做出选择激素疗法的决定。但她说，做这些决定需要与医护人员进行细致入微、深思熟虑的沟通，她不知道Alloy和其他在线服务提供商的机制是否能够做到。Alloy创始人之一安妮·福伦韦德说，支持小组中的一名病人在寻求处方时没有透露她的全部病史。在这一情况曝光后，Alloy的一名医生联系了她，就激素疗法的风险和益处进行了更加全面的后续咨询。在权衡我自己的选择时，我有时会直接向我采访过的医生寻求建议。我了解到，对于仍有怀孕风险的围绝经期妇女来说，低剂量避孕药物可以“平衡局面”，抑制生殖系统的关键部分，同时提供更稳定剂量的激素。另一种选择是使用宫内节育器(IUD)进行节育，同时使用低剂量雌激素贴片，这种贴片的药效甚至低于低剂量避孕药，因此被认为更安全。“装备太多了，”当性健康专家雷切尔·鲁宾建议我这么做的时候，我对她说。“所以我不滑雪。”然而我经常想起桑托罗说她给病人的忠告（尤其是60岁以下、身体健康的病人）：身体出现症状时，如果没有体验过治疗见效后的益处，你怎么能权衡这种疗法的风险和收益呢？11月，我开始服用低剂量避孕药。我和我身边的人都确信，我大脑的问题减少了。我没有潮热。最让我惊讶的是（也许这也是认知能力提高的主要原因）：我的睡眠改善了。鉴于我们讨论的时间太短，我甚至没有向我的妇科医生提到过我睡眠质量差的问题，但我也曾以为这是压力、年龄和一个体贴但打鼾的丈夫造成的。直到服用激素之后，我才意识到，我以前经常凌晨两点醒来，也很可能是围绝经期的症状。吃避孕药是个很简单的尝试，但它比宫内节育器和避孕贴有更高的潜在血栓风险；现在我确信使用宫内节育器是值得的，所以我决心一旦能够预约到时间，就立即改用这个方法。有多少女性和我曾经差不多一样，对更年期症状感到不确定或把它们轻描淡写，为抱怨自己不确定是否“严重”的不适而道歉，在与妇科医生、内科医生或家庭保健医生见面时默默地让话题换到下一个？然而……随着我的大脑运转得更加顺畅，我在思考、在担心、在等待更多高质量的研究。也许在下一个十年，当我的个人风险开始急剧升高，我们会懂得更多东西；我所能希望的是，它能证实目前的研究趋势，能让人放心。科学在前进。我们对进展翘首以待，盼着它像衰老本身一样必然到来。;Left
45;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230912/putins-forever-war/;普京的永恒战争;普京的统治就是要重建这个想象中的俄罗斯世界，或者说“俄罗斯米尔”，这是一个围绕着永恒的俄罗斯文化和帝国领域理念而建立的复仇主义神话，乌克兰是其中不可或缺的一部分，然而乌克兰却决定成为一个独立国家，这永远不可原谅。至于未来，普京几乎没有说什么，人们只能猜测。这不难看出：保镖冲进莫斯科的高档餐厅，为这个体制中的某些头目或寡头腾出空间，在这个体制中，必须对总统付出坚定不移的忠诚，才能获得巨大财富。最重要的是，正是出于恐惧，人们压低声音、犹豫不决，不敢说出普京双重思想中的那个险恶之词——“战争“。冷战的苏俄学，变成了另一项同样艰巨的任务：透过克里姆林宫的重重迷雾，弄清普京这位新沙皇在想什么——如今，他已经在自己执政的暮年。高压政策愈发凶狠，普京在乌克兰发起的战争，几乎全然不考虑自己的决策会造成什么后果，这种特质正是约翰·勒卡雷曾说的“精神变态的一项首要条件”。普京主义是矛盾事物的后现代汇集。它是伤春悲秋的苏联怀旧与黑手党式资本主义的结合，是对东征教会的虔诚和无所不在的破碎家庭的结合，是对“单极”的美国世界的猛烈攻击和俄罗斯帝国起死回生后的出击的结合——这一切都是通过对不同意见的无情镇压实现的，必要时会采取暴力手段。在俄罗斯有一个让人越来越解除戒备的现象，它看上去很像美国或欧洲，但其实并非如此。它是“运行在一种不一样的软件上的，”法国大使皮埃尔·列维对我说。对国家秘密的定义在不断改变。我得到的建议是，不要接受除了菜单以外的任何文件，即使是点菜也尽可能扫二维码。在俄罗斯武装部队大教堂的义务兵，向“俄罗斯人民的勇武功绩”致敬。与过去的纽带得到维持，普京在很大程度上已经让斯大林重回人间，尽管没有古拉格。真正的普京信徒在距离莫斯科五个时区的乌兰乌德，一座废弃的苏联时代燃煤发电厂喷出浓烟，笼罩在有波纹铁屋顶的木屋上。重达42顿的世界最大列宁头像，至今在这座人口超40万的城市的中央广场上耸立着。这座静悄悄的城市，如今是俄罗斯布里亚特共和国的首府，冷战时期，这里是固定翼飞机和直升机的生产中心，外国人不得进入，现在它再次卷入一场与西方的战争，而列宁的苏维埃联盟的解体，正是这场战争的根源所在。59岁的经济学家亚历山大·瓦西里耶夫即将第二次前往遥远的前线，他和国防部签了那种价值2500美元的合同。去年十二月，他的挚友维克多·普利卢科夫在索莱达尔附近被乌军火炮击中丧生。几天后，瓦西里耶夫被一枚榴弹炸上了天。“我不太擅长飞翔，”他说。他带着受了重伤的肩膀回到西伯利亚，如今基本已经痊愈。“钱当然是好东西，但那不是我重返的主要原因，”瓦西里耶夫说，他身形健硕，经常在他那间苏联时代的公寓里举铁。“参战是对祖国应尽的义务，”他说。“我们的祖父1945年一直杀到柏林，就为了确保我们不用跟一个敌国作邻居。我们不会让美国给我们安插这么一个邻居。”许多人对普京深信不疑，59岁的亚历山大·瓦西里耶夫就是这样，他将再次上前线。“我是出于对祖国的责任而战，”他说。他的厨房墙上有一个钟在说这番话的同时，，钟面上的普京和他的跟班——有时当他的替身——迪米特里·A·梅德韦杰夫直溜溜盯着他看。“这个钟是我妈妈十年前给我的，因为她觉得我整天骂他们！”他说。“你知道的，我们俄罗斯人常有的抱怨，税收和腐败。我们骂沙皇、斯大林和他的古拉格集中营、叶利钦——然后我们接受现实。”有的人则以更热忱的方式支持战争。44岁的尼古拉·沃罗德尼科夫邀请我去他的车库，他在那里修理车辆，准备送到前线去。他位于西伯利亚的车库已将大约100辆SUV和卡车运往乌克兰。他本人曾在乌克兰的马里乌波尔作战，一座被俄军夷为平地的城市。2022年4月，沃罗德尼科夫在冲进那里的主要行政大楼时胸部中了两颗子弹。在接受紧急护理后，他回到乌兰乌德修养了好几个月。和普京一样，他认为10世纪的基辅罗斯——其领土与今天的乌克兰部分重叠——是现代俄罗斯的诞生地，并且该地区一直是大俄罗斯不可分割的边疆。他说，俄罗斯和乌克兰是“一个整体”。“身上长了个肿瘤——长在乌克兰，我们必须治，”他告诉我。“带来肿瘤的是美国人，他们去了他们没必要去的地方。我们的任务明确且即将达成，正义将得到伸张，法西斯主义将被击败。”尼古拉·沃罗德尼科夫（左）位于西伯利亚的车库已将大约100辆SUV和卡车运往乌克兰。普京“是上帝派到俄罗斯的，”他说。我问他怎么看普京。“他是上帝派到俄罗斯的，”他说。神奇的解决方案在恐怖时期，广大民众要么热情高涨，要么顺从，要么精于算计，要么畏首畏尾。相比之下，一些勇敢的人会转向内心的指南针。39岁的叶夫根尼·弗拉索夫的麻烦始于去年底，当时他开始在Vkontakte（简称VK）上发表批评评论，VK相当于俄罗斯的Facebook。弗拉索夫是乌兰乌德的一名电气工程师，个头高瘦，有一种坦率和无畏，他发了一张来自反对派网站的图片，说明了战争造成的伤亡。图片显示，战争中每死亡一个莫斯科人，意味着达吉斯坦共和国死亡87.5人；他居住的布里亚特共和国死亡275人；以及图瓦死亡350人，图瓦是一个亚洲少数民族的家园，也是俄罗斯最贫困的地区。所有征兵广告牌上的图像几乎都是俄罗斯白人，与之相反的是，在前线阵亡的人中有很大一部分来自俄罗斯少数民族，Mediazona等独立新闻媒体证实了这一情况。这就是弗拉索夫要表达的。他的朋友告诉他停止发帖。他不理会。他认为自己是一个无名小卒，没有人会对他的反战视频感兴趣。弗拉索夫的朋友们大多钦佩普京，他们问他上次看电视是什么时候。他回答说：“我十年前就不再看了。都是垃圾。这就是为什么我有不同的观点。”什么样的观点？“我一直很愤怒，”他说。“我就是不明白为什么我们去年必须攻击乌克兰。没有什么正常的理由。”弗拉索夫认为，总统已经迷失了方向。2014年吞并克里米亚的过程非常顺利，普京认为消灭乌克兰也很容易。“唯一的问题是，”弗拉索夫说，“乌克兰一直在做准备，而普京的亲信却一直在偷窃数十亿美元，这就是为什么我们的士兵在四处寻找袜子。”思索片刻后，弗拉索夫说：“普京是个小偷。乌克兰战争向俄罗斯人展示了为建造他的宫殿而损失了多少资金。”去年12月，一名警察打电话命令弗拉索夫到当地派出所报到。弗拉索夫询问原因。对方没有给出任何理由。不管怎样，他还是去了。他被问那些含有批判战争的社交媒体页面是否是他的。他说是的。警方整理了一份报告，称他已经认罪——但他没有——并且如果他再犯，他将被罚款6万卢布（约合630美元），还会被监禁。弗拉索夫聘请了一位名叫纳德日达·尼佐夫金娜的律师，她是乌兰乌德政治反对派的活跃人士。“我为言论自由而战，但我也与正在发生的一切作斗争，”她告诉我。“根据宪法，我的当事人应该可以自由地发布他想要发布的内容。”在过去的六个月里，弗拉索夫已三次出庭。他的罚款最终减半，然后在4月被取消，但他尚未收到任何表明已结案的官方信息。弗拉索夫想要离开俄罗斯，他的孩子分别是10岁、9岁、4岁和2岁。他看不到一家人在乌兰乌德的未来。他的梦想是去加利福尼亚州当电工；他认为妻子可以在美甲沙龙找到一份工作。“普京在位太久了，孩子们都不会问下一个总统会是谁，他们问下一个普京是谁，”他说。“这可不是什么好事。”弗拉索夫回忆起2021年参加声援阿里克谢·A·纳瓦尔尼的示威活动，也就是那位被关押的反对派领袖，这周他又被判了19年徒刑，监狱的条件十分恶劣。“有很多人在抗议，”他说。“普京的支持率在下降。”两年下来，他的一些曾经参加抗议的朋友已经成了普京的支持者，他把这种态度的转变归咎于“战争带来的神奇解决方案”。我们约定第二天在南方公墓见面，那里距离乌兰乌德40分钟车程，坐落在一片松树林中。市中心的墓地已经没有更多空间了。我们漫步穿过广阔的墓地，经过骨瘦如柴的流浪狗和野餐桌，还有阳光下闪闪发光的大束彩色塑料花，周围是新挖的士兵坟墓。墓地的一整块都留给乌兰乌德的战死者。一对老夫妇正在准备一个坟墓，他们铲土，夯土。在他们准备安放的墓碑旁边，地上放着一个水平仪。。我问他们埋葬的是谁。“我们的孙子。”他多大了?“19”。出了什么事？“乌克兰的事。”墓碑上写着：安德烈·马利克，生于2003年5月4日，卒于2022年10月31日。当我读着这段铭文时，他们的女儿走过来，威胁说，如果谈话继续下去，她要就打电话给无处不在的联邦安全局。重新打一场旧仗5月30日，布里亚特共和国成立100周年庆典在华丽的乌兰乌德歌剧院举行，天花板上悬挂着苏联飞机的壁画，机身上有红星和印着列宁肖像的苏联国旗。该国首脑阿列克谢·齐杰诺夫是普京领导的统一俄罗斯党成员，他发表了半个小时的讲话，赞扬在“二战”中牺牲的3.9万名布里亚特人。然后，他表彰了八名在当前战争中被授予“俄罗斯英雄”称号的当地士兵。他将勋章别在其中三位英雄的衣襟上，又别在几位1941–1945年伟大卫国战争老兵的衣襟上，全场起立鼓掌。这是普京策划的将两场战争牵强融合的完美写照。“今天，新一代再次扮演了纳粹主义征服者的角色，”齐杰诺夫宣称。“我们的军队会赢的。在历史的各个阶段，总有人希望我们遭殃。但我们克服了所有障碍。”布里亚特共和国成立一百周年庆典上，过去和现在的英雄们都别上了勋章。“新一代的人再次扮演了纳粹主义征服者的角色，”普京所在政党的布里亚特州长说，他指出两场冲突之间的历史联系。随后是一场具有苏联风格的戏剧表演，其中包括一个全男性舞蹈团，他们随着一首歌颂煤炭生产的赞美诗旋转舞动，向下挥动手臂，唱着：“是的！是的！煤炭生产是我们的责任，整个俄罗斯支持我们！”在外面，气氛没有那么欢欣鼓舞。对许多人来说，平均每月几百美元的工资意味着艰苦的生活。伊琳娜·康措娃的两个女儿七岁和九岁，她们是从电视上得知了33岁的父亲马克西姆·康措夫去年在乌克兰去世的消息。她感觉自己无法对她们说出口。她的大女儿玛格丽塔早早从学校回来，看到电视上宣布她的父亲获得了俄罗斯金星英雄奖。我们开车去了那对夫妇第一次见面的高中。学校正面新贴了一块牌匾，是为了纪念康佐夫的英勇行为，他在遥远的土地上为一位年迈领导人的执念而牺牲。康索娃是林业专家，她站在牌匾旁边。“你无法击垮俄罗斯人民，”她说。“尤其是俄罗斯女性。”伊琳娜·孔索娃在纪念其前夫马克西姆·孔索夫的牌匾旁。看着她，我满脑子想的都是这一切带来的浪费，没有父亲的孩子，纠缠不清的历史留下的有毒遗产，以及所有那些为纪念战争的血腥牺牲而颁发的奖章。“沉默之塔”她的书桌上放着打字机，还有她的眼镜、笔记和一本书，书的标题总结了普京时代的有罪不罚现象：《调查无定论的历史》(History

Investigation)。你要走过自2000年以来被杀害的另外六名《新报》记者的照片。他们以不同的方式遵循了伟大的战时摄影师罗伯特·卡帕的格言，穆拉托夫在诺贝尔奖获奖感言中引用了这句话：“如果你的照片不够好，说明你离得不够近。”61岁的穆拉托夫坐在一间挂着米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫照片的办公室里，这位领导人现在受到许多俄罗斯人的唾弃，他拒绝共产主义，支持言论自由、企业自由和开放边界。“他对待活物非常小心，”穆拉托夫告诉我。“他是一个农民。他珍视生命。现在，在我们国家，死亡比生命更重要。”“我们是一个窒息的社会，”被关闭的独立报纸《新报》的编辑德米特里·A·穆拉托夫说。过去17个月就像送葬队伍的行进。政府开战没多久就关闭了《新报》以及其它一些最独立的媒体。报社的一个分支《欧洲新报》目前在拉脱维亚的里加出版。穆拉托夫还是待在俄罗斯，他称这是个“视真相为犯罪”的国家。宣讲真相的人——纳瓦尔尼、大声批评克里姆林宫的弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎、批评战争的伊利亚·雅辛、戏剧导演叶夫根尼亚·贝尔科维奇和无数作家与诗人——都已经身陷囫囵。“我们是个窒息的社会，”穆拉托夫说。“俄罗斯已经成为一座无声的巨塔。”他说，没人知道国家是怎么想的。唯一知道的是老一辈像信教一样相信普京。至于年轻人，自开战以来已经有多达一百万最优秀、最明智的年轻人离开俄罗斯。穆拉托夫说，这些人不想杀人和被杀。他们不认为荣誉可以通过流血来获得。他们倒是相信，荣耀在艺术和知识中。他认为，要取代这群人，需要经历一个或几个世代的时间。在俄罗斯还有一些愤怒的年轻人。在临近俄乌边境的别尔哥罗德地区，乌克兰的越境攻击迫使数万俄罗斯人逃离家园，我在这里遇见了19岁的伊利亚·科斯秋科夫。牧师在为应征入伍的士兵祈福。自战争开始以来，多达100万不想杀人或被杀的俄罗斯年轻人逃离了家园。靠近俄罗斯西部边境的别尔哥罗德地区的舍贝基诺遭到乌克兰人的反击。他在去年因为反战而被大学开除，不过他已经学到了足够多的知识，足以从事他称为“律师”的工作，主要是帮助迫切想要避免上前线或离开前线的俄罗斯人。“我们在政府最高层放了个FSB的人，我们让土匪来运作和统治，我们觉得，无论出了什么问题，都可以通过一场选举来修正，”科斯秋科夫说，“但是等人们开始明白过来已经晚了——于是现在就这样了！”在俄罗斯生活表象之下，潜藏着一场剧烈的代际冲突。冲突何时爆发尚不得而知，但看起来总有一天会爆发。在莫斯科，我问穆拉托夫是什么促使普京对乌克兰发起无所顾忌的侵略。“他对西方产生了极度的厌恶，”穆拉托夫说。“这些领导人和政客会到莫斯科来，”上午去波利特科夫斯卡娅坟前祭拜，与公民社会代表大谈人权，然后他们会去见普京，签下石油天然气合约。伊利亚·科斯图科夫因反对战争而被大学开除，现在他帮助绝望的俄罗斯人避开或离开战争前线。“他们卸任后，”他说，“普京会收买他们——前德国总理格哈德·施罗德、前法国总理弗朗索瓦·菲永——他们都欣然接受普京的钱。于是他就得出结论，西方嘴上说的价值观都是垃圾。”在穆拉托夫看来，普京还得出了另一个结论：西方各国抓住后苏联时代俄罗斯的弱点，抹杀红军在1945年一路杀到希特勒的柏林这样的功绩。西方因此侮辱了2700万在战争中丧生的苏联人，这其中就有普京的哥哥。他的父亲当时身受重伤。西方是通过将北约东扩至俄罗斯边境来实现这一目标的，在普京看来，这本身就是背信弃义。“于是普京决定，要获得已经结束的第二次世界大战的胜利，”穆拉托夫说。“他要保护那场战争的胜果。这就是为什么要告诉我们，我们是在和纳粹和法西斯作战。”苏联专制共产主义统治的结束，1989年柏林墙的倒塌，都奇迹般地没有流血，但现在看来，其实并非如此。一种新的国家意识形态在普京看来，战争的性质已经扩大，成为对西方的文明之战。它也许是在乌克兰进行，但莫斯科的敌人远不止于此。用俄罗斯外国情报机构负责人谢尔盖·纳雷什金近日的话说，美国、欧洲和北约现在被一致认定为“彻头彻尾的恶魔崇拜”之源。既然成了意识形态战争，就会愈发难以控制。“目前完全没有和谈的基础，”克里姆林宫发言人迪米特里·S·佩斯科夫对我说。“我们会在可见的未来继续这场行动。”反西方的恶言恶语已经达到光怪陆离的程度。这是一种正在成形的国家意识形态的一部分，为接下来几十年的潜在冲突埋下伏笔。上世纪90年代，对自由主义充满热忱期待的俄罗斯通过了一部宪法，其第13条写道，“任何意识形态不得被确立为国家的或必须服从的意识形态。”三十年后，普京的俄罗斯正加速走向一种秉守保守主义价值观的新官方意识形态。包括司法部长康斯坦丁·丘琴科在内的一些人提出了修宪废除第13条的可能性。这种反西方意识形态是围绕东正教会、祖国、家庭和“精神高于物质”的观念建立起来的，后者在普京于11月发布的关于精神和道德价值的政令中得到体现。政令宣称美国以及“其它不友好的外国政府”是敌人，意图培育“自私、悲观、背德和对爱国主义理想的否定”，并且要“通过推广非传统的性关系来摧毁传统家庭”。如果说在冷战中西方被描绘为冷酷资本主义的恐怖大本营，那么在现在的俄罗斯看来，它是性改变、变装皇后泛滥、野蛮的性辩论和LGBTQ称霸的源头。“面对西方公然利用乌克兰的人肉发起的战争，俄罗斯还要忍耐多久？”背景深厚的俄罗斯外交专家谢尔盖·卡拉加诺夫在接受采访时说。“核战的风险很高，并且越来越高，”他说。“这场战争就是加长版的古巴导弹危机，但这一次面对的是否定母性、父母之道、性别、爱国、信仰、神明等正常价值观的西方领导人。”俄罗斯这种几乎不加掩饰的核威胁是这场对西方的厉声讨伐行动的一部分。从3月底到5月，俄罗斯一直在表示，一个正面冲突的新阶段已经到来。《华尔街日报》记者埃文·格尔什科维奇被以间谍罪名逮捕，这是冷战以来第一次逮捕外国记者，美国政府和他所在的报社都强烈否认这一指控。四个月后，他仍在莫斯科的列福尔托沃监狱忍受煎熬。过去近75年来一直处于俄美合作核心的莫斯科英美学校在5月12日的法庭裁决下彻底关闭，一家地方报纸指责该校传播LGBTQ价值观。在接下来2024年3月的俄罗斯总统大选中，普京无疑会毫无顾忌地利用这种意识形态的讨伐和在乌克兰的战争。他的再度当选几乎是板上钉钉，他将得到一个之后可以继续连任的六年任期。《华尔街日报》记者埃文·格什科维奇在莫斯科一家法院受审，他是冷战以来第一位被捕的西方记者。去年在莫斯科一家同性恋俱乐部举行的万圣节狂欢，尽管有国家宣传，派对仍在继续。“我们的总统选举其实不算民主，只是昂贵的官僚政治，”克里姆林宫发言人佩斯科夫说。“普京先生明年将以超过90%的得票率再次当选。”普京的支持率唯一一次出现下跌是在去年9月，也就是下达局部动员令的时候。“我们看到普京的民调出现30年来最大幅度的隔夜下滑，”俄罗斯唯一大型独立民调机构勒瓦达中心的主任丹尼斯·沃尔科夫在莫斯科对我说。“战争突然出现在了眼前。”据专注于登门调查的勒瓦达的数据，普京的支持率从80%跌倒了50%左右。此后普京的支持率恢复到了80%左右，至于民调在当前环境下能有多可靠就见仁见智了。尽管与大量证据相左，普京仍坚称乌克兰是一个法西斯和纳粹控制的国家，并且西方想把乌克兰变成又一个性别转换道德堕落的大本营，因此他成功地将一场侵略战争变成了卫国战争，本质上是在拯救俄罗斯，让它的实体和道德构造免遭被肢解的命运。去年在莫斯科，一名俄罗斯义务兵正在拥抱他的伴侣。莫斯科，学生们奔向胜利博物馆。“我们看到的不是一个在位数十年的当权势力会使用的那种四平八稳的语言，”卡内基俄罗斯欧亚中心的鲍诺夫说。“这是一个掌握核武的大国，在散发出一种革命者的炽热。”浪漫主义者普京在普京时代末期有一种镜像效应。他对西方和乌克兰的指责——侵略、法西斯主义、核威胁——成了他自己的行动。乌克兰的马里乌波尔在2023年被俄罗斯夷为平地的样子更像1943年被纳粹摧毁的斯大林格勒（今伏尔加格勒）。这位俄罗斯领导人心中的复仇之火在乌克兰战争前夕达到了顶峰。因苏联解体而失去克里米亚成为一个久久不愈的伤口，因为俄罗斯人普遍认为那是国家历史的一个核心组成部分。“普京执着于他所认为的公道，”阿里克谢·A·韦涅季克托夫说，他的电台“莫斯科回声”曾经很受欢迎，但在战争开始后很快遭到取缔。“他在2014年对我说，‘你可能对克里米亚的并入有不满，但那是正当的。’”韦涅季克托夫说他跟普京很熟。他认为所有人，包括他自己，都对这位俄罗斯领导人有误解。“我们看不到那个肩负着复仇历史使命的普京，”他告诉我。“我们以为他是一个腐败的家伙，出身贫困家庭，想要游艇、宫殿、女人和金钱。我们不觉得他是个认为苏联的解体不公平的克格勃官员。我们认为他是个冷血自私的人。事实上，他是个浪漫主义者。”“我们看不到那个肩负着复仇历史使命的普京，”阿列克谢·A·韦涅季克托夫说。民族主义不是法西斯主义，但它是法西斯主义的重要组成部分。承诺以虚幻过去的名义改变现在，打造一个除了荣耀之外，在各方面都很模糊的未来，这就是它的永恒本质。对普京来说，历史是塑造当前事件的工具。他对历史真相完全不感兴趣，”奥列格·奥尔洛夫说。他是一位重要的人权活动人士，担任“纪念”团体的负责人30多年，该组织于2021年被取缔。现年70岁的奥尔洛夫目前正在受审，罪名是“采取公开行动，诋毁对俄罗斯联邦武装部队的使用”。他最多可面临三年的监禁。多年来，普京政权动用了一切手段来重振和重塑历史。“我的历史”主题公园遍布各地，俄罗斯人记住他们的英雄事迹，从13世纪抵抗蒙古人到纳粹入侵。围绕军事主题开展的课程和课外活动也向孩子们灌输了这种思想。5月9日的胜利日庆祝活动中，数以百万计的俄罗斯人举着先烈的画像在全国各地游行，这是俄罗斯卫国战争胜利庆祝的一大特色。然而，今年，在一场低调的仪式上，这些所谓的“不朽军团”活动被取消了。即将离任的德国驻俄罗斯大使格萨·安德烈亚斯·冯·盖尔告诉我：“也许克里姆林宫担心有人会拿着在乌克兰阵亡儿子的照片游行。”俄罗斯的孩子们在围绕军事主题的课程和课外活动中接受灌输思想。今年的胜利日纪念取消了游行中展示烈士画像的活动。去年战争开始时，奥尔洛夫独自站在红场上，举着一条横幅，上面写着“1945：一个战胜法西斯主义的国家。2022：一个法西斯主义获胜的国家。”他告诉我，现在有两个选择。第一种是普京以某种方式被取代，然后开始一段改革时期，就像斯大林之后的赫鲁晓夫时期一样。“第二种选择更为现实，那就是普京政权继续存在，俄罗斯慢慢消亡，”奥尔洛夫说。“它将落后于其他国家，为了使这个政权稳定，镇压会加剧。”三位西方驻俄罗斯大使在莫斯科告诉我，普京几乎肯定拥有足够的国家支持和资金支持，让他至少再打18个月到两年的战争。我问克里姆林宫发言人佩斯科夫，在被吞并的四个省之外，俄罗斯是否希望获得更多的乌克兰领土。“对普京来说，历史是塑造当前事件的工具，”著名人权活动人士奥列格·奥尔洛夫说。“不，”他说。“我们只想控制我们现在写进宪法的所有土地。”俄罗斯陷入漩涡贝加尔湖上的渔业博物馆是一座部分沉入水中的木制建筑，已正式关闭。但客栈老板罗里科娃认为有必要看看它，于是她打开了锁着的门，眼前过去一个世纪以来俄罗斯的缩影。到处散落着放咸鱼的木桶、雪橇、渔网、长凳，以及渔民们乘着木船驶向浩瀚湖面的褪色照片。我想起了法国哲学家罗兰·巴特的一句话：每一张老照片都潜藏着灾难。墙上挂着卫国战争时期的苏联海报：“大鱼上前线！”“赶超计划是所有渔夫的责任！”一桶桶咸鱼被拖过数千公里的俄罗斯大草原，给红军带去滋养，让他们一路打到希特勒统治的柏林，这样的景象似乎概括了苏联人的巨大决心和牺牲，普京坚称，他必须通过更多的战争来纪念这种决心和牺牲。“没有人来问我们：我们是否想要这场战争？”罗里科娃说。在从贝加尔湖返回乌兰乌德的路上，普京为扭转历史而发动的战争的代价是随处可见的。墓园里埋葬着安德烈·梅佐夫，这名2000年出生的海军步兵于2022年3月6日死在了乌克兰。他来自附近的塔洛夫卡镇，曾在国立贝加尔大学读书，并在符拉迪沃斯托克的军队服役。一面海军步兵旗在花束上方飘扬。旗帜上写着海步口号：“所到之处，皆是胜利。”贝加尔湖的渔业博物馆里，褪色的照片和共产主义时代的海报展现了苏联的决心。克里姆林宫附近的一处小型纪念地，反对派领袖鲍里斯·Y·涅姆佐夫于2015年2月27日在这里被枪杀。每次我去墓园探视战争死难者的坟墓，FSB特工都会把车停在50米开外的地方，作为一种委婉的提醒。在莫斯科的最后一天，我去了毗邻克里姆林宫的莫斯科河大桥。一处小型纪念碑标出了反对派杰出领袖鲍里斯·Y·涅姆佐夫在2015年2月27日被枪杀的地点，那是一场明目张胆的政治谋杀。这里总有人在守护，确保纪念花束的新鲜的。这一天，这个任务落到了阿尔卡季·科尼科夫身上，他告诉我：“涅姆佐夫是个诚实的政客，这是很不寻常的。他是个勇敢的人，一个伟大的人。”涅姆佐夫去世前一年，也就是大约十年前俄罗斯在乌克兰顿巴斯地区挑起的战斗开始时，他在自己的Facebook页面上写道：“普京已对乌克兰宣战。这是一场自相残杀的战争。俄罗斯与乌克兰将会因为这个精神不稳定的秘密警察特工的血腥疯狂而付出惨痛代价。两国的年轻男性会死在战场。母亲和姐妹将伤心欲绝。”前段时间，戈尔巴乔夫于2022年8月30日去世之前，《新报》主编穆拉托夫去探望了这位正躺在莫斯科医院里的朋友。曾做出给俄罗斯人自由这个决定的苏联领导人身体状况急剧恶化，已经基本失去意识。去世后，普京没有参加他的葬礼。病房里有一台大电视。电视中一遍遍播放着乌克兰战火纷飞的影像。就在穆拉托夫离开时，他听到戈尔巴乔夫说：“谁会因此而高兴呢？”;Left

50;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/news/;The Athletic;EDMONTON — There was a collective exhale mixed with outright euphoria as the final buzzer sounded. On one hand, the Edmonton Oilers were soundly outplayed by the Dallas Stars on Sunday night. The Western Conference’s top seed, with their season on the line, certainly wasn’t rolling over and carried most of the play. But the Oilers, who scored the first two goals of the game, managed to survive the onslaught as a Jason Robertson shot went wide with seconds left on the clock. That’s where the pandemonium comes in. The Oilers edged the Stars 2-1 in Game 6 of the conference final to book their ticket to their first Stanley Cup Final since the underdog run of 2006. Nine years into the Connor McDavid era, the thing that just had to happen, finally — finally — did. The Oilers have just four more wins to go to earn the big trophy. Skinner was great The Oilers don’t win this game without Stuart Skinner. Full stop. He was their best player. The ice became more and more tilted in Dallas’ favor as the game progressed, but the Oilers goalie was up to the challenge nearly every time there was a shot that came his way. This might have been his best performance of the playoffs, which couldn’t have come at a better time since the Stars dominated at five-on-five. Skinner’s two best saves came in the third period with the result hanging in the balance. He stopped Robertson point blank with his blocker and kicked on his right pad on Logan Stankoven in the slot. Though he allowed a tap-in goal to Mason Marchment, Skinner still turned aside 34 pucks as his Oilers were outshot 35-10. The Stars were supposed to have the goaltending advantage in this series, but Skinner outdueled counterpart Jake Oettinger — especially over the last three games. Skinner surrendered just four goals over the final three contests, all victories by Edmonton. He came through when it mattered most. “He was unbelievable tonight,” McDavid said. “We’re not sitting up here talking about a win if it wasn’t for him. We’re on a plane to Dallas if it wasn’t for Stu.” McDavid magic McDavid can skate unlike anyone else in NHL history. He thinks the game two steps ahead. His play with the puck is jaw-droppingly good. There’s a reason — or a few — that he’s regarded as the best player going today. McDavid’s sublime talents were on display early in Game 6. The Oilers captain scored the most electrifying goal of the 2024 playoffs and the prettiest one of his postseason career just 4:17 into the game. With the Oilers on a power play, McDavid took a cross-ice pass from Leon Draisaitl before deftly sidestepping Sam Steel. From there, it was showtime. He caught Miro Heiskanen — a Norris Trophy-caliber defenseman — leaning and toe-dragged around him like he was a beer-leaguer. He then chipped a backhander over Oettinger for a few extra style points. McDavid was just as noticeable on the next Oilers man advantage. He stripped Chris Tanev in the corner to recover a puck and then made a beautiful pass to set up Zach Hyman for his 14th goal of the playoffs later in the shift. McDavid was the offensive difference-maker in this game. That goes for the series, too. McDavid, who opened the series with a double-overtime goal in Game 1, had three goals and 10 points in the six games. He’s now the leading scorer of the playoffs with 31 points. Oilers special teams superiority There’s no question where this series was won. The Oilers dominated the special teams battle, something that was especially apparent in Game 6. The Oilers scored on their first two power plays — the magnificent McDavid effort and the Hyman snipe. Those two goals, when added to the pair they scored on three opportunities in Game 5, meant the Oilers cashed in on four of their final five chances. That put them at 4-for-11 over the six contests. On the other side, they killed off each of the Stars’ three man advantages on Sunday — including one in the third period that was highlighted by the blocker save by Skinner on Robertson and a huge shot block by Darnell Nurse. The Oilers thwarted all 14 power play chances the Stars had in the matchup. Oh, and they scored a short-handed goal courtesy of Mattias Janmark in Game 4. The Oilers haven’t allowed a power-play goal since Game 3 of the Vancouver series, a span of 10 games and 28 chances. Pretty, pretty good. What went wrong for the Stars? The Stars were the third-highest-scoring team in the league during the regular season, averaging 3.59 goals per game — right up there with the high-octane Avalanche and Maple Leafs. But the offense dried up almost completely late in this series. After scoring five goals in the second and third periods of Game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead, Dallas managed just four goals over the final three games, including two over the final six periods. There’s plenty of blame to go around. The power play, which was the sixth-best in the league this season, went an almost unfathomable 0-for-14 in the conference final, often looking overwhelmed by the high-pressure Oilers penalty kill. The Stars’ penalty-kill, eighth-best in the league, held its own against the mighty Oilers power play for the first four games, but got annihilated in Games 5 and 6, giving up four goals on five opportunities in a four-period span that ultimately decided the series. And other than Tyler Seguin’s two-goal Game 1 and Robertson’s Game 3 hat trick, the Stars got virtually no offense from its cadre of scoring forwards. Joe Pavelski, Jamie Benn, Roope Hintz, Matt Duchene and Stankoven combined for just two goals in the series. Skinner was supposedly the weak link in this matchup, but he ended up being a difference-maker in net for Edmonton, particularly in Games 5 and 6. And while it’s tough to blame Oettinger for Edmonton’s power-play goals, the fact is, he was mostly ordinary in the last three games, all Oilers wins. After posting a .938 save percentage in the first three games, he gave up nine goals on 64 shots in the last three, for an .859 save percentage. A spectacular streak snapped: Since Pete DeBoer became head coach in Dallas at the start of last season, the Stars were the only team in the NHL to not lose three consecutive games in regulation. After going up 2-1 this series, Dallas dropped three straight in regulation. — Saad Yousuf (@SaadYousuf126) June 3, 2024 No top gun In an effort to goose his offense, Stars coach Pete DeBoer took a chance and put rookie Mavrik Bourque into the lineup. Bourque, the AHL’s leading scorer and MVP this season, had just one regular-season NHL game under his belt, but was eager for the opportunity, having joined the team as an extra during the Colorado series after the Texas Stars’ postseason run ended. He started the game centering a line with Steel and Pavelski, and stayed on the fourth line when DeBoer shook things up in the second period, swapping Pavelski and Evgenii Dadonov. But Bourque was a non-factor in the game, playing just 7:56, by far a team-low among forwards. (Photo of Zach Hyman and Connor McDavid: Perry Nelson / USA Today);Left

While the order is yet to be released, I am supportive of the details provided to me thus far.”The order would represent the single most restrictive border policy instituted by Mr. Biden, or any modern Democrat, and echoes a 2018 effort by President Donald J. Trump to block migration that was assailed by Democrats and blocked by federal courts.;Left

Trump has described his plans to remove large numbers of unauthorized immigrants from the country if elected to a second term by citing the mass deportations under President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s.In that initiative, federal agents and law enforcement officers used military techniques such as sweeps, raids and surveillance checkpoints — as well as a blunt form of racial profiling — to round up undocumented workers and load them onto buses and boats. As many as 1.3 million people were expelled, mostly Mexican and Mexican American workers, some of whom were U.S. citizens. Critical to the initiative — named Operation Wetback, for the racial slur — was intense anti-immigrant sentiment. Officials at the time used that sentiment to justify family separations and overcrowded and unsanitary detention conditions — practices that the Trump administration would deploy decades later in its own immigration enforcement.As the 2024 presidential election heats up, some Latino advocacy and immigrant-rights groups are sounding the alarm that Mr. Trump’s tactics could amount to a repetition of a sordid chapter of American history. But recent polling shows that Mr. Trump’s position on immigration appears to be resonating. About half of Americans have said they would support mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, according to a CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS in January.Authorities have reported record numbers of migrant apprehensions at the southern border for three straight years, including 2.4 million apprehensions in the fiscal year that ended in September 2023. Although the numbers have dropped sharply in recent months, immigration remains an albatross for President Biden: Even some Democratic mayors have complained that they need help from the federal government to contend with the migrant populations in their cities.;Left

In doing so, he could make it even harder for Mr. Sunak and his party to narrow a double-digit gap in the polls with the opposition Labour Party.Divisive, charismatic and famed for his communication skills, Mr. Farage was one of the architects of Brexit, which a slim majority of Britons supported in a 2016 referendum. An earlier decision by Mr. Farage not to run this year was thought by some analysts to have sapped momentum from his party, Reform U.K., the successor to the Brexit Party he once led.Mr. Farage said last month that he would not seek a parliamentary seat because he wanted to prioritize supporting Donald J.

More than a million Gazans have crowded into shelters and tents in the southern city of Rafah, which Israel seems poised to invade.

Israel would withdraw from major population centers in Gaza, and a number of hostages would be released, including women, the elderly and the wounded. The hostages would be exchanged for the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees. Aid would begin flowing into Gaza, working up to some 600 trucks a day. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians would also be allowed to return to their homes in northern Gaza. Most Palestinians fled the north following Israel’s mass evacuation order before the ground invasion began.During the first phase, Israel and Hamas would continue to negotiate to reach a permanent cease-fire.

Here’s the key part of the ruling:The State of Israel shall, in conformity with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and in view of the worsening conditions of life faced by civilians in the Rafah Governorate: Immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.Sure enough, for several days some legal scholars have been arguing about whether the clause that begins “which may inflict” put conditions on the order to “immediately halt.”;Left

Place names are written in the Ottoman Arabic script.The mosque site in the heart of Gaza City has been a place of worship for thousands of years, dating back, according to some accounts, to the Philistines whose temple walls were said to have been pulled down by Samson, the Israelite warrior.A Christian Byzantine church erected in the fifth century on top of the ruins of an earlier Roman temple was repurposed in the seventh century as a mosque following the Muslim conquest of Gaza. Some researchers suggest the space may have served both Muslims and Christians during this period. But that building was destroyed when Gaza fell to the Crusaders around 1100, and a church was later built at the site. Parts of the church, in particular its central nave, were repurposed as a mosque in the 12th century when Muslims regained control of Gaza.An 1873-74 survey of the mosque showed a bas relief of a menorah and Jewish ritual symbols, which remained on an interior column until the late 1970s when, during the Israeli occupation of Gaza, they were erased, possibly in protest. Palestine Exploration Fund, via Internet ArchiveOver the centuries that followed, the building often suffered serious damage from invaders and earthquakes. But it was constantly rebuilt and expanded, first by the Mamluks, who created a powerful Islamic empire during the later Middle Ages, and later the Ottomans. The Mamluk efforts included the addition of a stone arcade to align the eastern wall toward Mecca and the design of an octagonal minaret. The Ottoman contributions included walls added to the courtyard.Among scholars, the mosque became known for its expansive library of ancient Islamic manuscripts, including religious texts, literature and social and political commentary.The library and much of the rest of the mosque were destroyed in 1917 by a British artillery bombardment during World War I. The British said they were targeting an Ottoman arms depot inside the mosque, and they would go on to capture the rest of the area.Inside the central nave, after British bombardment partially destroyed the building in 1917. American Colony Photo Department (Jerusalem), via Library of CongressThe sandstone building, including its library and minaret, was rebuilt roughly a decade later under a restoration authorized by the Supreme Muslim Council that employed the very fabric of the mosque’s history, such as surviving remnants from the Crusader church and the Mamluk arcade.Some researchers even suggest that the interior columns that were rescued and reused may have been ancient late Roman-era originals once used to build the Byzantine church. Others discount that, suggesting the columns were created long afterward but mimicked the Roman style.One interior column once featured a bas relief with Jewish ritual symbols, though many experts do not believe the site was ever used as a synagogue. Rather, they say, that column possibly originated in an ancient synagogue somewhere in the region and was reused during the building’s reconstruction.Over the centuries, the courtyard outside became a plaza for much more than prayer.One of the gates of the mosque leading to the Zawya market in May 2019.

Now, It’s Worse.;Access to Aid in Gaza Was Dire. Now, It’s Worse.The flow of aid into Gaza has shrunk so much in May that humanitarian officials say their operations are at risk of shutting down, and that the threat of widespread starvation is more acute than ever.Aid trucks entering Gaza fall far short of meeting need Southern crossings Northern crossings U.S.-built pier350 The minimum number needed, according to U.N. officials 300 May 7 Israel seizes Rafah crossing in incursion 200 100 May 1 May 23 350 The minimum number needed, according to U.N. officials 300 200 May 7 Israel seizes Rafah crossing in incursion 100 May 1 May 23The entry of aid trucks through Gaza’s southern crossings, where most aid has arrived since the war began, has nearly ground to a halt since Israel expanded its fighting in the southern city of Rafah. In northern Gaza, new entry points have enabled small amounts of critical aid to reach those who have been most at risk of famine for months. But that aid is insufficient to support the Gazan population, and most cannot reach the central and southern areas, where a majority of people are newly displaced by the war.A ruling issued by the International Court of Justice on Friday appeared to order Israel to halt its military offensive in Rafah, although at least some of the court’s judges said limited operations could continue despite the decision. The ruling made explicit note of the “spread of famine and starvation” in Gaza and emphasized the need for “the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance.”Last month, Israel had pledged to increase the aid it allowed into Gaza after the killing of seven World Central Kitchen workers in an attack by Israeli forces drew international outrage. Israel’s strict controls on aid and the challenge of distributing it within the enclave had already created catastrophic levels of hunger.Under pressure from President Biden, Israeli officials began to bring additional aid through the port of Ashdod and opened the Erez crossing in the north, which Israel had closed after the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. In coordination with Israel, the U.S. military built a temporary pier to bring in aid by sea, a supplement to key land routes in the south.But in early May, Israel expanded its military operation in southern Gaza after a Hamas rocket attack killed four soldiers near a crossing at Kerem Shalom. Israel closed that crossing as well as the Rafah crossing, where a majority of aid had been coming in. Nearly 300 aid trucks had crossed there in a single day just before the incursion.“It was a record for us since the outbreak of the war,” said Georgios Petropoulos, the head of the United Nations aid office in Rafah. “We were kind of saying, ‘OK, well, maybe were getting to where we need to be.’ And then boom, suddenly its gone.”Erez crossing Erez West crossing U.S.-built aid pier Israel GAZA STRIP Rafah crossing Kerem Shalom crossing EGYPTAid entrypoint Current status Rafah crossing The crossing remains closed after it was seized and shut down by Israel during its incursion into Rafah. Kerem Shalom crossing Israel reopened this southern crossing on May 8, but a very limited amount of aid and fuel, and almost no medical supplies, have entered there since. Erez and Erez West crossings More aid has come through these crossings, which have been open since early May, than through others since May 8, but the amounts satisfy just a fraction of the overall need. U.S.-built aid pier The U.N. said on May 22 that about 60 trucks’ worth of food has been delivered to warehouses via the pier, less than the U.S. military’s goal. Aid groups temporarily suspended distribution last week after security issues. Airdrops A few trucks’ worth of aid enters by air sporadically.Israel reopened Kerem Shalom on May 8, but aid workers from multiple organizations have said the vital entry point remains functionally closed, with a daily average of just eight aid trucks entering. One reason is that Egypt has refused to allow trucks from the closed Rafah crossing to continue on to Kerem Shalom.Mr. Biden and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt agreed on Friday to send aid and fuel to Kerem Shalom until the Rafah border crossing could be reopened. On Sunday, 126 trucks carrying food and other aid from Egypt reached that crossing, according to a statement by the Israeli military. The U.N. distribution trucks that made it to Kerem Shalom to pick up the Egyptian aid were forced to evacuate the crossing because of a security issue, said Sam Rose, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA. Officials including Mr. Rose said the aid had not made it past the crossing as of Sunday.Scott Anderson, a senior official at UNRWA, and Mr. Petropoulos have said that the crossing area is still an active military zone and that safety and logistical challenges can hold up aid that arrives at the crossing and prevent it from being immediately collected and distributed. An Israeli airstrike on a makeshift tent camp in Rafah killed at least 45 people on Sunday night, according to the Gaza health ministry. The Israeli military said the strike was aimed at a Hamas compound.Empty trucks coming from inside Gaza en route to load aid at Kerem Shalom often sit in hours-long waits behind commercial trucks carrying goods to sell in Gaza, which officials say number more than 100 or 200 per day. While humanitarian groups say they welcome the arrival of commercial supplies, most people inside Gaza cannot afford them, and the shipments may not include basic necessities.Getting aid to people in Gaza is also difficult because Israel’s expanded operations in the south and north have forced nearly a million people to flee to areas with little shelter, food or water on the coast or among the rubble in more central regions.Before the Rafah operation, most people were sheltering in the areas where a majority of the aid was coming in. But now, new entry points in the north — the U.S. pier, and a new crossing called Erez West — are beset with problems. They bring in too little aid to sustain everyone and are located far from the largest clusters of people.Before the Rafah operationApril 23 through May 6 94 aid trucks entered through crossings in the north North Gaza and Gaza An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people at the end of April Middle Area and Khan Younis About 500,000 Rafah Up to 1.3 million, a majority of Gazans, were sheltering here 2,636 trucks entered through crossings in the south After the Rafah operationMay 7 through May 20 465 trucks North Gaza and Gaza An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people in mid-May 40 trucks of aid delivered via the U.S. pier Middle Area and Khan Younis About 1.5 million, a majority, are crowded here now 143 trucks entered through Kerem Shalom crossing Rafah About 300,000The distribution of the aid that does make it through each crossing also poses significant challenges. Israel’s recent evacuation orders in parts of Rafah and northern Gaza have made many aid agency warehouses unreachable and travel more dangerous. UNRWA announced on May 21 that it had suspended distribution in Rafah, citing security issues, supply shortages and an inability to access its warehouse.Without consistent, predictable deliveries of aid, many trucks do not make it far through desperate crowds. For instance, on May 18, the World Food Program reported that 11 of 16 trucks were looted after leaving the U.S. pier.An Israeli military road and checkpoint in the north, which bisects the enclave and prevented the easy movement of aid from the south to the north earlier in the war, is likely to create a similar problem for aid moving in the opposite direction, according to Mr. Petropoulos.COGAT, the Israeli military agency coordinating aid delivery, has said that increasing the amount of aid going into Gaza remains a priority. It reports daily that it has inspected hundreds of trucks and coordinated their transfer to border crossings, though the figures are often higher than those reported by aid organizations, which track the number of trucks that have collected goods for entry into Gaza and exclude trucks carrying commercial goods.Neither set of figures accounts for difficulties in distribution that can prevent aid from getting to Gazan civilians. Israel says enough aid is entering Gaza and has blamed aid groups for not distributing it faster to civilians — a characterization the aid groups dispute, saying Israeli forces have made distribution extremely difficult.Aid organizations have also warned that they will be unable to deliver supplies to anyone if they run out of fuel, and that already inadequate amounts of safe water supplies will disappear. At least 200,000 liters of fuel are needed daily, according to Mr. Anderson of UNRWA. But just a quarter of that amount arrives on average each day since the closure of Rafah crossing, according to U.N. data.“The fuel limitation means that we often have to choose: Do we keep the generators running at the hospital, the bakery or the sewage plant?” Mr. Anderson said.;Left

That would deal a further blow to a relationship that Israel’s offensive had already pushed to its lowest point in decades.But when Israel’s military said last week that it had taken “tactical control” of the zone, known as the Philadelphi Corridor, the same government mouthpieces were quick to say that the area had nothing to do with Egypt. Sovereignty went unmentioned.It was the latest indication that for all the hard feelings and security fears provoked by Israel’s devastating campaign in the Gaza Strip, Cairo sees little choice but to protect its 1979 peace treaty with Israel. The accord has generated valuable military and intelligence cooperation against Egyptian insurgents and natural gas imports from Israel, as well as a close relationship with the United States and billions of dollars in American aid.For Israel, too, the “cold peace” with Egypt has been an essential pillar of national security for 45 years. It has given Israel a path to better relations with Arab countries, some of which have normalized their ties, making Israel an increasingly integral part of a regional, anti-Iranian axis. For the same reasons, the United States also considers the treaty, which grew out of the Camp David Accords, crucial to regional stability.Still, Israel took the risk of upsetting that delicate balance, saying that it must control the narrow buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt for its own security. Israel says it needs to destroy dozens of tunnels under the border that have enabled Hamas to smuggle in arms — despite Egypt’s avowals that had stopped the smuggling years ago.Image Israel contends that Hamas smuggles arms into Gaza through tunnels beneath the border fence with Egypt. Credit... Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe Israeli military’s push into southern Gaza and the city of Rafah in recent weeks has seriously strained ties with Egypt, raising questions about how far Israel will go in insisting on control over the Philadelphi Corridor, and how much of a continued Israeli presence there Egypt will tolerate.Hussein Haridy, the former head of Israeli affairs at Egypt’s foreign ministry, said Israel’s occupation of the area, with troops “only meters” from the border, amounted to “a direct threat to Egyptian national security.”Egypt, he added, is deeply suspicious that Israel plans to maintain some degree of control over the border permanently.“It becomes even more threatening since there’s no withdrawal timetable or commitment to withdraw,” he said.Israel, with the United States’ backing, has pressed Egypt to heighten security at its border with Gaza by building a high wall extending below ground, with sensor systems that would alert both the Israeli and Egyptian militaries to tunneling and smuggling, according to Mohammed al-Zayat, an analyst at the state-linked Egyptian Center for Strategic Studies, as well as Israeli security experts.But Egypt fears that such alarms could draw Israeli military action along the border. The presence of Israeli troops there risks further angering the many Egyptians who are already upset about what they perceive as their country’s weakness in the face of the Israeli takeover, and who still regard Israel as an enemy.Image Israeli soldiers at the border with Egypt in southern Israel in February. Credit... Ronen Zvulun/ReutersWith Israel troops on the border, Egypt sees a growing prospect of Israel pushing Gazans to flee, creating a refugee crisis within Egypt, giving Hamas a foothold there and potentially endangering hopes for a future Palestinian state. And Egypt wants to show both its own people and its foreign partners that its military-dominated regime, which took power promising security and stability, is competent enough to manage the border by itself.The 1979 peace treaty is “the cornerstone of Egyptian foreign policy, it’s the whole justification of the $1.3 billion that the Americans give the Egyptians every year,” said Riccardo Fabiani, an Egypt analyst at the International Crisis Group. “So if somebody says the Egyptians aren’t reliable, you can’t trust the Egyptians when it comes to this very delicate border, this whole thing comes apart.”Israel’s takeover of the Philadelphi Corridor leaves Egypt feeling threatened, with few cards to play.To convey its displeasure, Cairo has registered to speak in support of South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. It has also warned that Israel is jeopardizing the treaty.Though it has denounced Israel for cutting off humanitarian aid to Gaza, Egypt itself took the extreme step last month of temporarily suspending the flow of supplies from its own territory in an attempt to force the United States to pressure Israel into withdrawing from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The sight of the Israeli flag flying over that border point, the main conduit for aid and other goods during the war, had drawn public outrage in Egypt.Image The Rafah border crossing with Egypt was one of the main portals for aid trucks to enter the Gaza Strip, but it has been closed since Israeli forces seized the Gaza side last month. Credit... Mohamed Abd El Ghany/ReutersBut Egypt has refrained from taking more serious steps against Israel. Unlike Jordan, it has not withdrawn its ambassador from Tel Aviv.“No one is interested in any kind of escalation, so I believe they will find a solution to satisfy the Israeli side,” said Mohamed Anwar el-Sadat, an independent Egyptian politician and who is a nephew of the president who signed the 1979 treaty. “It’s in both our interests to reach an understanding or agreement to avoid any kind of confrontation.”The government-managed news media appears to have been helping with efforts to limit public outrage.Before Israel said that it had established control of the Philadelphi Corridor, the rhetoric from news outlets verged on bellicose. Egypt is “ready for all scenarios, and will never allow any encroachment on its sovereignty and its national security, either directly or indirectly,” Ahmed Moussa, a prominent talk show host, wrote in a column for Al-Ahram, Egypt’s flagship daily newspaper, on May 17.Yet after Israel took the corridor, Mr. Moussa was on the air, fulminating against social media users who said it made Egypt look weak. He linked such “allegations” to the Muslim Brotherhood, the political Islamist group — of which Hamas is an offshoot — that Egypt’s government has long demonized as a terrorist organization.“The Philadelphi Corridor is not Egyptian territory,” Mr. Moussa said in a nine-minute segment devoted to the issue, displaying a giant map. “It’s Palestinian territory. It doesn’t belong to us.”The Israeli-Egyptian relationship has weathered wars and Palestinian uprisings, the 2011 Egyptian revolution that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak, and the brief presidency of Mohamed Morsi, the senior Muslim Brotherhood leader who won Egypt’s first free elections a year later.Rafah and the eight-mile-long Philadelphi Corridor have often served as points of connection and friction between Egypt and Israel. The two countries jointly enforced a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave in 2007, soon after Egypt and Israel had agreed on the number of troops that could be stationed around the buffer zone.But the question of smuggling remained contentious. In 2005, when Israel unilaterally withdrew its forces and Jewish settlers from Gaza, many Israeli strategists said it was a mistake to abandon the corridor to the smugglers. Current and former Israeli officials say that once Hamas came to power, the Rafah crossing became a main channel for weapons smuggling, which peaked as Egyptian security broke down during Mr. Morsi’s tumultuous presidency.But Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led a military coup that overthrew Mr. Morsi in 2013, and became president a year later. He has since forged a close security partnership with Israel over their shared interest in stamping out an insurgency in northern Sinai, the Egyptian region bordering Gaza and Israel.Image A smuggling tunnel between Egypt and Rafah in 2012. Credit... Andrea Bruce for The New York TimesSeeing Hamas as a security threat, Egypt spent years cracking down on smuggling into Gaza, destroying and flooding tunnels, and constructing walls. The Egyptian and Israeli militaries also developed strong links, including a regular communication channel to discuss smuggling, counterterrorism and intelligence sharing. Israel even agreed to allow Egypt to station more troops along the border than they had previously agreed to.Given the Egyptian public’s deep antipathy toward Israel, neither side trumpeted their cooperation. But Mr. el-Sisi acknowledged in a 2019 interview that Egypt had “a wide range of coordination” with Israel.That may have been the high point. When news reports surface about Egyptian-Israeli talks about the border these days, Egyptian officials are quick to deny any coordination.Israel, however, still sees the advantages of the relationship, especially since it may need Egyptian help in managing Gaza after the war.“There was a close strategic dialogue with the Egyptians, and we need to preserve that,” said Efraim Inbar, an expert on Israel’s strategic doctrine and president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security.;Left

But the agreement collapsed, and in September, he was indicted in Delaware on three charges stemming from his illegal purchase of a handgun in 2018, a period when he used drugs heavily and was prohibited from owning a firearm.The tax charges have always been the more serious element of the inquiry by the special counsel, David C. Weiss, who began investigating the president’s son five years ago as the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney for Delaware. Mr. Weiss was retained when President Biden took office in 2021.Mr. Biden “engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019,” Mr. Weiss wrote.“Between 2016 and Oct. 15, 2020, the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes,” he added.If convicted, he could face a maximum of 17 years in prison, Justice Department officials said.Read the Tax Indictment Against Hunter Biden The president’s son was indicted on nine counts accusing him of evading federal taxes on millions of dollars he has made in his work with foreign companies. Read Document 56 pagesThe charges, while serious, were far less explosive than ones pushed by former President Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans, who have been angry with the department for failing to find wider criminal wrongdoing by the president’s son and family.Many of the facts laid out in the indictment were already widely known, and the litany of Mr. Biden’s actions tracks closely with a narrative he drafted with prosecutors in the plea deal that collapsed over the summer.Prosecutors said that he “subverted the payroll and tax withholding process of his own company,” Owasco PC, by withdrawing millions from the coffers that he used to subsidize “an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills.” They also accused him of taking false business deductions.Mr. Weiss called out Mr. Biden for failing to pay child support and his reliance on associates, including the Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris, to pay his way. Prosecutors included a chart that tracked the cash he siphoned from Owasco’s coffers — $1.6 million in A.T.M. withdrawals, $683,212 for “payments — various women,” nearly $400,000 for clothing and accessories, and around $750,000 for restaurants, health and beauty products, groceries, and other retail purchases.Throughout the document, Mr. Weiss presented an unflattering split-screen of Mr. Biden, scooping up millions in income and gifts from friends while stubbornly refusing to pay his taxes. That pattern even persisted into 2020, after he had borrowed money to pay off his tax liabilities from the previous few years, prosecutors wrote.“Defendant spent $17,500 each month, totaling approximately $200,000 from January through Oct. 15, 2020, on a lavish house on a canal in Venice Beach, Calif.,” they wrote, adding that “the I.R.S. stood as the last creditor to be paid.”In a statement, Abbe Lowell, Mr. Biden’s lawyer, said Mr. Weiss had “bowed to Republican pressure” and accused him of reneging on their previous agreement.“If Hunter’s last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought,” he said.Luke Broadwater and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.;Left

Trump’s felony conviction in New York.A year ago, the younger Mr. Biden seemed unlikely to face trial on the weapons charges he was facing over a firearms application that prosecutors say was falsified, or from more serious charges of failing to pay taxes from overseas business activities at a time when he was using drugs and alcohol heavily and spending lavishly.But a plea deal, which offered him some immunity from prosecution and did not include prison time, imploded in July. The judge in the case punched holes in the agreement, to the delight of Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress who tried to scuttle that deal and have portrayed Hunter Biden’s legal problems as equivalent to those of their party’s 2024 presidential candidate in an effort to impeach President Biden.Still, it is the son — not the father — who will be on trial twice during an election year. On Monday, he is set to report to the fourth-floor courtroom of Judge Maryellen Noreika when jury selection begins at 9 a.m. in a trial expected to last three to five days. The other, set to begin in September, involves a series of tax offenses related to his failure to file returns for a number of years.;Left

Here’s Why.;On the face of it, Hunter Biden appears at risk of being sentenced to as long as 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines if he is convicted on the three gun charges brought against him by federal prosecutors on Thursday.In reality, few people fitting Mr. Biden’s profile — a first-time, nonviolent offender accused of lying on a federal firearms application, who never used the gun (in his case, a Colt Cobra .38 that he held onto for less than two weeks five years ago) to commit a crime — get serious prison time for the offenses charged in the indictment.Just bringing the charges is out of the ordinary in some ways, former law enforcement officials say, and the legal basis of the prosecution is under constitutional challenge.Here’s a rundown of the accusations against President Biden’s son and what makes the case unusual.What are the charges?The indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Wilmington, Del., charged Mr. Biden with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail, making a false claim on the federal firearms application used to screen applicants, with a sentence of up to five years, and possession of an illegally obtained gun from Oct. 12 to Oct. 23, 2018, which carries a maximum of 10 years.;Left

He receives updates from his aides each morning on the war in Gaza and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calls his advisers to quiz them about the latest polls and headlines.But at the top of that list, people who know him say, is a concern that nags at him as a father: the legal problems of his son, Hunter Biden.Hunter Biden, 54, is scheduled to stand trial this week in a federal court in Delaware on charges that he failed to disclose his drug addiction on a form when buying a gun in 2018. His legal team has called the charges politically motivated, and his attorneys intend to challenge the notion that Hunter Biden improperly filled out the form.The president has weathered years of personal and legal scandals surrounding his son, who has battled alcoholism and addiction, and the trial is the most serious legal problem facing him since Mr. Biden was elected to the presidency. But Mr. Biden has refused to shut out his son or treat him as a political liability — in fact, the president has a tendency to pull his son closer the worse things seem to get.;Left

Source photographs by Getty Images.On Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci will return to the halls of Congress to testify before the House subcommittee investigating the Covid-19 pandemic. He will most likely be questioned about how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he directed until retiring in 2022, supported risky virus work at a Chinese institute whose research may have caused the pandemic.For more than four years, reflexive partisan politics have derailed the search for the truth about a catastrophe that has touched us all. It has been estimated that at least 25 million people around the world have died because of Covid-19, with over a million of those deaths in the United States.Although how the pandemic started has been hotly debated, a growing volume of evidence — gleaned from public records released under the Freedom of Information Act, digital sleuthing through online databases, scientific papers analyzing the virus and its spread, and leaks from within the U.S. government — suggests that the pandemic most likely occurred because a virus escaped from a research lab in Wuhan, China. If so, it would be the most costly accident in the history of science.Here’s what we now know:1 The SARS-like virus that caused the pandemic emerged in Wuhan, the city where the world’s foremost research lab for SARS-like viruses is located.At the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a team of scientists had been hunting for SARS-like viruses for over a decade, led by Shi Zhengli.Their research showed that the viruses most similar to SARS‑CoV‑2, the virus that caused the pandemic, circulate in bats that live roughly 1,000 miles away from Wuhan. Scientists from Dr. Shi’s team traveled repeatedly to Yunnan province to Their research showed thatScientists from Dr. Shi’s team traveled repeatedly to Yunnan province to collect these viruses and had expanded their search to Southeast Asia. Bats in other parts of China have not been found to carry viruses that are as closely related to SARS-CoV-2.The closest known relatives to SARS-CoV-2 were found in southwestern China and in Laos.

There are many cities in between.Even at hot spots where these viruses exist naturally near the cave bats of southwestern China and Southeast Asia, the scientists argued, bat coronavirus spillover into humans is rare . Even at hot spots where these viruses exist naturally near the cave bats of southwestern China and Southeast Asia, the scientists argued, as recently as 2019 , thatWhen the Covid-19 outbreak was detected, Dr. Shi initially wondered if the novel coronavirus had come from her laboratory , When the Covid-19 outbreak was detected, saying she had never expected such an outbreak to occur in Wuhan.The SARS‑CoV‑2 virus is exceptionally contagious and can it left no known trace of infection at its source or anywhere along what would have been a thousand-mile journey before emerging in Wuhan. The SARS‑CoV‑2 virus is exceptionally contagious and can jump from species to species like wildfire .

Then they would create new coronaviruses by inserting spike proteins or other features that could make the viruses more infectious in humans. Finally, they would infect human cells, civets and humanized mice with the new coronaviruses, to determine how dangerous they might be.While it’s possible that the furin cleavage site could have evolved naturally (as seen in some distantly related coronaviruses), out of the hundreds of SARS-like viruses cataloged by scientists, SARS‑CoV‑2 is the only one known to possess a furin cleavage site in its spike. And the genetic data suggest that the virus had only While it’s possible that the furin cleavage site could have evolved naturally (as seen in some distantly related coronaviruses),in its spike. And the genetic data suggest that the virus had only recently gained the furin cleavage site before it started the pandemic.Ultimately, a never-before-seen SARS-like virus with a newly introduced furin cleavage site, matching the description in the Wuhan institute’s Defuse proposal, caused an outbreak in Wuhan less than two years after the proposal was drafted.When the Wuhan scientists published their they did not mention the virus’s furin cleavage site — a feature they should have been on the lookout for, according to their own grant proposal, and a feature quickly recognized by other scientists. When the Wuhan scientists published their seminal paper about Covid-19 as the pandemic roared to life in 2020,— a feature they should have been on the lookout for, according to their own grant proposal, and a feature quickly recognized by other scientists.Worse still, as the pandemic raged, their American collaborators failed to publicly reveal the existence of the Defuse proposal.

According to U.S. intelligence sources, some of the institute’s virus research was classified or conducted with or on behalf of the Chinese military. In the end, American partners very likely knew of only a fraction of the research done in Wuhan. According to U.S. intelligence sources,3 The Wuhan lab pursued this type of work under low biosafety conditions that could not have contained an airborne virus as infectious as SARS‑CoV‑2.Labs working with live viruses generally operate at one of four biosafety levels (known in ascending order of stringency as BSL-1, 2, 3 and 4) that describe the work practices that are considered sufficiently safe depending on the characteristics of each pathogen.

An analysis of SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary tree shows how the virus evolved as it started to spread through humans. The viruses that infected people linked to the market fall partway down this tree, suggesting that they were most likely not the earliest form of the virus that seeded the pandemic.Not a single infected animal has ever been confirmed at the market or in its supply chain. Without good evidence that the pandemic started at the Huanan Seafood Market, the fact that the virus emerged in Wuhan points squarely at its unique SARS-like virus laboratory.5 Key evidence that would be expected if the virus had emerged from the wildlife trade is still missing.In previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, scientists were able to demonstrate natural origin by collecting multiple pieces of evidence linking infected humans to infected animals.

They found infected animals, the earliest human cases were exposed to animals, there was antibody evidence in animal traders, ancestral variants were found in animals, and there was documented trade of host animals. For SARS-CoV-2, all of these pieces of evidence are missing.Despite the intense search trained on the animal trade and people linked to the market, investigators have not reported finding any animals infected with SARS‑CoV‑2 that had not been infected by humans. Yet, infected animal sources and other connective pieces of evidence were found for the earlier and MERS Despite the intense search trained on the animal trade and people linked to the market,that had not been infected by humans. Yet, infected animal sources and other connective pieces of evidence were found for the earlier SARS outbreaks as quickly as within a few days, despite the less advanced viral forensic technologies of two decades ago.Even though Wuhan is the home base of virus hunters with world-leading expertise in tracking novel SARS-like viruses, investigators have either failed to collect or report key evidence that would be expected if Covid-19 emerged from the wildlife trade . For example, investigators have not determined that the earliest known cases had exposure to intermediate host animals before falling ill. No antibody evidence shows that animal traders in Wuhan are regularly exposed to SARS-like viruses, Even though Wuhan is the home base of virus hunters with world-leading expertise in tracking novel SARS-like viruses,. For example, investigators have not determined that the earliest known cases had exposure to intermediate host animals before falling ill. No antibody evidence shows that animal traders in Wuhan are regularly exposed to SARS-like viruses, as would be expected in such situations.With today’s technology, scientists can detect how respiratory viruses — including SARS, MERS and the flu — circulate in animals while making repeated attempts to The virus appears to have succeeded in causing a pandemic upon its only detected jump into humans. With today’s technology, scientists can detect how respiratory viruses — including SARS, MERS and the flu — circulate in animals while making repeated attempts to jump across species . Thankfully, these variants usually fail to transmit well after crossing over to a new species and tend to die off after a small number of infections. In contrast, virologists and other scientists agree that SARS‑CoV‑2 required little to no adaptation to spread rapidly in humans and other animalsThe pandemic could have been caused by any of hundreds of virus species, at any of tens of thousands of wildlife markets, in any of thousands of cities, and in any year. But it was a SARS-like coronavirus with a unique furin cleavage site that emerged in Wuhan, less than two years after scientists, sometimes working under inadequate biosafety conditions, proposed collecting and creating viruses of that same design.While several natural spillover scenarios remain plausible, and we still don’t know enough about the full extent of virus research conducted at the Wuhan institute by Dr. Shi’s team and other researchers, a laboratory accident is the most parsimonious explanation of how the pandemic began.Given what we now know, investigators should follow their strongest leads and subpoena all exchanges between the Wuhan scientists and their international partners, including unpublished research proposals, manuscripts, data and commercial orders. In particular, exchanges from 2018 and 2019 — the critical two years before the emergence of Covid-19 — are very likely to be illuminating (and require no cooperation from the Chinese government to acquire), yet they remain beyond the public’s view more than four years after the pandemic began.Whether the pandemic started on a lab bench or in a market stall, it is undeniable that U.S. federal funding helped to build an unprecedented collection of SARS-like viruses at the Wuhan institute, as well as contributing to research that enhanced them. Advocates and funders of the institute’s research, including Dr. Fauci, should cooperate with the investigation to help identify and close the loopholes that allowed such dangerous work to occur. The world must not continue to bear the intolerable risks of research with the potential to cause pandemics.A successful investigation of the pandemic’s root cause would have the power to break a decades-long scientific impasse on pathogen research safety, determining how governments will spend billions of dollars to prevent future pandemics. A credible investigation would also deter future acts of negligence and deceit by demonstrating that it is indeed possible to be held accountable for causing a viral pandemic. Last but not least, people of all nations need to see their leaders — and especially, their scientists — heading the charge to find out what caused this world-shaking event. Restoring public trust in science and government leadership requires it.A thorough investigation by the U.S. government could unearth more evidence while spurring whistleblowers to find their courage and seek their moment of opportunity. It would also show the world that U.S. leaders and scientists are not afraid of what the truth behind the pandemic may be.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Nearly a million households lost power. Which meant that not only was there no light, but there was no air-conditioning. The damage from the storm was so extensive that, five days later, more than 100,000 homes and businesses were still marooned in the heat and darkness.Luckily, the day the derecho blew in, the temperature in Houston, a city infamous for its swampy summers, was in the low to mid-80s. Hot, to be sure, but for most healthy people, not life-threatening. Of the at least eight deaths reported as a result of the storm, none were from heat exposure.But if this storm had arrived several days later, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend, when the temperature in Houston hit 96 degrees, with a heat index as high as 115, it might have been a very different story. “The Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat,” is how Mikhail Chester, director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, once put it to me, echoing the memory of the catastrophic 2005 hurricane that struck Louisiana, devastated New Orleans and killed more than 1,300 people.;Left

The solutions to this brewing crisis — such as comprehensive testing — have been there all along, and they’re becoming only more important. If we keep ignoring the warning signs we have only ourselves to blame.H5N1 has long been more than a bird problem. The virus has found its way into dairy cattle across nine states, affecting 69 herds that we know about. Of the three human cases of H5N1 that have been identified, all involve farmworkers who were in direct contact with infected cows or milk. The first two cases were relatively mild, involving symptoms like eye irritation, or conjunctivitis. However, the most recent case has shown more concerning signs, including coughing.The emergence of respiratory symptoms is disconcerting because it indicates a potential shift in how the virus affects humans. Coughing can spread viruses more easily than eye irritation can.;Left

Delivering a speech to a group of Belgian businessmen this year, Barack Obama warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence, climate change and geopolitical conflict. More local matters were close at hand: Belgium was entering an election year, and its capital, Brussels, home to some of Europe’s most hallowed institutions, had weathered a year of geopolitical shocks. Yet Mr. Obama wouldn’t be drawn into questions about national politics. A visit to the Magritte Museum and the king was the extent of his engagement.The hesitancy is understandable. In what is billed as the largest election year in human history, with about half of the planet heading to polls, Belgium cuts a rather inconspicuous figure. The country’s politics are colorful and forbiddingly complex, outsiders are prone to be puzzled by a country with a population roughly equal to metropolitan Paris’s that has six governments across three regions and three languages. On June 9, Belgians go to the polls, including for a round of European Parliament voting. Anyone worried about the direction of the continent should pay attention.For all its singularity, Belgium tells a quintessentially European story. Against a backdrop of ailing public services, precarious labor markets, waning traditional parties and intractable regional divisions, a far right is readying itself for power. In Brussels, the seat of the European Union, rising crime, pollution and decaying infrastructure symbolize a continent in decline. With unusual clarity, Belgium shows what Europe has become in the 21st century: a continent subject to history rather than driving it.Set within the European panorama of decline, Belgian politics also exhibit some curious features: The work force unionization rate has remained steady at around 50 percent in the past 10 years, and Belgium has had an impressive record on inequality and wages. Yet this has hardly stopped the politics of resentment in the country, which is particularly potent in the Dutch-speaking northern region of Flanders.;Left

Stole Sudan’s Future - The New York Times;On the evening of April 14, 2023, I was at a concert in Khartoum. The end of Ramadan was near, and the audience listened to the ouds, tambours and kanoons of Bait Al Oud, an orchestra set up to preserve traditional Sudanese instruments. I sang along to songs made popular by the 2019 revolution and then floated home, my spirits high.The next day I watched fighter jets fire rockets into the neighborhoods where I grew up.Thousands of people have been killed since fighting erupted just over a year ago between the Sudanese Army and the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful paramilitary group that is the latest iteration of the janjaweed, or devils on horseback, which was central to the ethnic cleansing in Darfur in the 2000s. The R.S.F. helped to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019 and, with its general Mohamed Hamdan (widely known as Hemeti), was part of a power-sharing regime that fell apart in April.Now it is at war with its former partners in government, and the Sudanese people have become collateral damage. A report from Human Rights Watch in May detailed the R.S.F.’s ethnic-cleansing campaign against the Masalit and other non-Arab people in West Darfur. There have been other reports of summary executions, torture and rape. Across the country, more than 11 million people have been displaced. Homes have been occupied and looted. Museums have been targeted and their contents probably sold, destroyed or just taken.In the 2021 coup, the R.S.F. and the military delayed the revolution’s dream of a democratic, pluralistic Sudan.

For the safety of the jurors, perhaps there is a way to do this without divulging their identities.This won’t silence the Republican leaders rallying to the ex-president, but it may resonate with average Americans looking for a fair and truthful voice to explain why the former president is now a convicted felon.David BaldwinPetaluma, Calif.To the Editor:There have been a number of letters and opinion pieces criticizing the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, claiming that he has been too creative weaving existing laws together in order to make the case for a felony versus a misdemeanor, and that the charges would have never been brought if Donald Trump had been an ordinary citizen.I don’t doubt this is true, and I applaud Mr. Bragg for the courage of his conviction (pun intended) and creativity. The jurors didn’t seem to have any problem with his case.;Left

This was validated when, a little before 4 p.m., Justice Juan Merchan came into the courtroom and told us that the jury would be excused at 4:30 and would resume deliberations on Friday.Then crickets. For more than half an hour, we heard nothing — certainly not the buzzy bell we expected if the jury had a note to send or a verdict.The judge had left the bench to tell jurors he was excusing them and hadn’t come back.I had a nice whispered chat with Andrew Giuliani, a fervent Trump supporter who was sitting behind me. I told him I expected a conviction and asked him if he would blame his fellow New Yorkers who had spent many hours painstakingly examining the evidence. He said yes and took a shot at Matthew Colangelo, the federal prosecutor who came in from the Justice Department to help the D.A.’s office.“That’s totally unprecedented!” Giuliani said, previewing some of the team’s damage-control spin. I reminded him that this had been done countless times in civil rights cases in the South and complex local prosecutions.Around 4:30 p.m., Merchan mounted the bench and announced that he had received a note from the jury. I first thought it was another request for more evidence to be read back. This was a conscientious jury that had been deliberating since midday on Wednesday. But the note said that a verdict had been reached and jurors needed another half-hour before announcing it.You could hear a collective gasp in the courtroom.At 5:03 p.m., the jury entered. After the foreman, an Irish-born former waiter clad in a blue pullover, stood and confirmed that the jury had reached a verdict, he was asked about each count and said “guilty” 34 times.The defense was asked if it wanted to waive its right to poll the jurors and, of course, said no. When asked, “Is that your verdict?” each of the other 11 jurors — their poker faces intact — calmly answered, “Yes.”Trump had become a felon.Merchan thanked the jurors for their service in a “very stressful and difficult task” and told them they are “free to discuss the case, but you are also free not to. The choice is yours.”Then came what I have always viewed as the most moving part of the trial, a ritual of democracy performed eight times a day, as the jury moves back and forth for breaks and lunch and exits when court adjourns:The jurors marched past Donald Trump without looking at him, soldiers for justice.Trump’s lead attorney, Todd Blanche, moved for a “judgment of acquittal” because there’s “no way this jury could have reached a verdict without accepting the testimony of Michael Cohen.”Merchan thought he heard Blanche say that even the judge knew Cohen had perjured himself on the stand. Blanche backtracked, and the motion was denied with dispatch.At the request of Blanche, who has other Trump legal proceedings to deal with in June, Merchan set sentencing for July 11. It struck me that since Trump is guilty of 34 felonies in the first degree, he is unlikely to get off with a slap on the wrist. First he will have to undergo a probation interview, followed by a probation report.This summer, will we be discussing ankle bracelets in the White House? Quite possibly.Merchan asked for Trump’s current bail status.In what may have been my favorite line of the day after “guilty,” the prosecution lawyer Joshua Steinglass said, “No bail, judge.”In another trial, that might mean the felon had been denied bail. Here it was a simple recognition of the stark reality that a jury had just convicted a former president of the United States, who would not be sent to a holding cell.As usual, Trump walked up the center aisle, swinging his right arm out in an exaggerated handshake with his son Eric. He looked more hunched than usual, with pain on his face.In the elevator a photographer who has been shooting him for years said, “I have never seen him looking so tired.”;Left

The Cases for and Against. - The New York Times;Now that Donald Trump has been convicted on 34 felony counts, his sentencing hearing looms on July 11. Below are two legal experts weighing in on the critical question of whether Mr. Trump ought to receive a prison sentence.The Case for Prison Time for TrumpBy Norman EisenHaving witnessed every day of Donald Trump’s criminal trial for falsifying business records to conceal a sex scandal that threatened his presidential campaign, I strongly believe the former president should be sentenced to incarceration.I am a lawyer, not a judge, but I have practiced criminal law for over three decades. Under New York law, sentencing should be based on the gravity of the crime — and the 34 offenses on which Mr. Trump has now been convicted are profoundly serious. To find him guilty of felony business record falsification, the jury had to determine that he intended to commit, aid or conceal a second crime by making or causing false entries.Jurors were given only one option for that second offense. That was the payment of hush money to hide damaging information, “a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election” under New York’s criminal code. Joshua Steinglass, one of the prosecutors, underscored the significance of that in his closing argument, telling jurors, “Democracy gives people the right to elect their leaders, but that rests on the premise that the voters have access to accurate information about the candidates.” Mr. Trump sought “to deny that access, to manipulate and defraud the voters, to pull the wool over their eyes in a coordinated fashion,” Mr. Steinglass said.;Left
89;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/02/opinion/temporary-celibacy-sex-abstinence.html;Celibacy Is Having a Moment. Embrace It. - The New York Times;In his first letter to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul issues one of Christianity’s better-known if lesser-observed dictates: It’s best to remain unmarried, full stop. But, he continues, if people “cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.”The message was clear: Celibacy is best, marriage is a concession. But as the centuries progressed this hierarchy collapsed, first in Christianity and then in the broader secular world. Now some form of committed sexual monogamy is the norm and “celibacy” has become largely associated in the news with unhappy men on Reddit who think they can’t get a girlfriend because they’re too short.It’s quite a comedown.Yet celibacy — by which I mean deliberately going without sex — persistently returns to the public conversation. When the dating app Bumble recently ran cheeky ads admonishing women with the line “Thou shalt not give up on dating and become a nun,” the company might have expected to rile only a handful of traditional Catholics, but instead it angered its user base and was forced to apologize. Lenny Kravitz just announced his own sexual abstinence, and Julia Fox’s recent boast of celibacy as a way to “take back the control” recalled a similar statement from Lady Gaga in 2010, when she announced that periods of celibacy allowed her to be “strong and independent.”If I search TikTok today for “celibacy,” the videos — mostly, though not exclusively, by heterosexual women — form a resonant chorus: Why have sex if the sex is usually bad? Why have sex with people who don’t respect you? Why not walk away until somebody can make it worth your while? Much of the current vogue for celibacy is not driven by a desire to discipline the flesh but by disgust with the digital-age dating scene.;Left

Quickly.;Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted on three felony gun charges in a trial that is set to begin in Wilmington, Del., on Monday. In the meantime, his father is behind in many polls, his financial benefactor is reportedly “tapped out” and his best legal arguments require gutting federal gun control laws. An embarrassing trial that he is likely to lose will only make things worse.An early plea agreement — in which he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement on the gun charges — fell apart last summer. But a criminal defendant can accept a plea deal from the prosecution anytime before the jury returns its verdict, which means that he might still have a chance to avoid a full trial.If he can, he should.To bring federal charges, the Department of Justice manual advises that a prosecutor should believe that the defendant is guilty, that the prosecutor believes he has evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the prosecutor believes that a reasonable jury would convict the defendant. In practice, this means that once the Department of Justice has indicted you, they believe they will win. And they almost always do.Over a 12-month period ending last fall, just 290 of the nearly 72,000 federal criminal defendants charged by the Justice Department were acquitted at trial. That’s less than one half of 1 percent. (Of course, only 1,379 were convicted at trial — a paltry 2 percent.) The vast majority facing a D.O.J. indictment decided either to plead guilty outright or accept a plea deal, believing that the prosecutor had correctly weighed their chances of winning in front of a jury before bringing the case in the first place.;Left

As Frederick Douglass wrote in 1860, after an angry mob shut down an abolitionist event in Boston, “No right was deemed by the fathers of the Government more sacred than the right of speech.”“Liberty,” he went on, “is meaningless where the right to utter one’s thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down.”That’s exactly right, and that’s why Sonia Sotomayor’s opinion for a unanimous Supreme Court upholding the free speech rights of the N.R.A. against a hostile attack from a Democratic official in New York has ramifications well beyond New York politics and well beyond the battle over gun rights. By upholding the free speech rights of the N.R.A., the Supreme Court reinforced the constitutional wall of protection against vengeful government leaders, including Trump.;Left

Will He Again?;Last month, Yoav Gallant told Israelis that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was leading the nation astray. Mr. Gallant, the defense minister and a member of the war cabinet, accused him of letting the nation drift into a military and civilian occupation of Gaza, which would cost Israel “blood and many victims, with no aim.” He challenged Mr. Netanyahu to rule that option out.In a government known for ironclad loyalty to the prime minister, and in the heightened intensity of war, Mr. Gallant’s statement made headlines. It also made him into a two-time whistle-blower of sorts.In March 2023, Mr. Gallant became the most prominent member of the governing coalition to publicly call for a halt to Mr. Netanyahu’s attempt to undermine the judiciary, an effort that he said was harming the country’s security. When Mr. Netanyahu tried to fire him, hundreds of thousands of protesting Israelis brought the country to a standstill, and Mr. Gallant became an instant symbol of a bulwark against what the protesters viewed as an autocratic putsch.At both these moments, liberal Israelis have grasped at the possibility that Mr. Gallant could be a lifeline out of national perdition. They hoped his stance against the judicial reforms would embolden other coalition members to halt the process, or even topple the government. His more recent challenge of Mr. Netanyahu conveyed that he might take a stand against a government poised to fulfill the fantasies of its religious extremists, who would conquer and resettle Gaza, while transforming Israel unrecognizably.;Left

And since Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 counts, Justice Merchan has come under further vicious attack.As a retiree, I was able to attend each day of the Trump trial. What I saw was a master class in what a judge should be — how one can serve fairly and impartially for the prosecution and the defense, and above all remain a pillar for the rule of law in America.Since the indictment over the cover-up of hush-money payments was issued last year, Justice Merchan has been subjected to an unrelenting pressure campaign. The defendant, Mr. Trump, and his supporters viciously attacked the judge and his family in deeply personal terms. Most judges strive to maintain their composure under the greatest of stress, but few succeed — yet Justice Merchan remained cool, calm and collected at every step of the trial.;Left

This time, things have gone much more smoothly, and there is great excitement among everyone at Madrid over the arrival of one of the world’s best players, especially with the squad that just won the club’s 15th European Cup/Champions League already brimming with young talent.AdvertisementBut that doesn’t mean the free-agent transfer has been without intrigue — and nor was it totally unopposed.This is the full story of how Madrid finally signed Mbappe.The start of 2024 marked the beginning of the end.In early January, at Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex — where the club’s offices are also located — it was agreed that a final attempt to sign Mbappe would be made.Several meetings were held on the matter, but some senior figures at Madrid were not convinced it was a good idea.The thinking behind this was two-fold. First of all, there were concerns the club’s interests could be damaged again after Mbappe’s rejection two years ago. Others simply thought the time was not right — for both sporting and economic reasons.Some preferred to be more cautious with the club’s finances — which are in good shape, even with the extensive remodelling of their Santiago Bernabeu stadium, which will cost at least €1.3billion (£1.1bn, $1.4bn at current rates).Some thought the positive dressing-room atmosphere could be affected by Mbappe entering as the highest-paid player when the vast majority of his new team-mates had won more trophies for the club. Some thought Madrid could get by fine without him — especially with 17-year-old Brazilian Endrick set to arrive and the team already performing admirably.In short: there was a view that Madrid’s project was working really well without Mbappe.But club president Florentino Perez decided nonetheless that another attempt would be made, with the above factors taken into account. It was also decided that Mbappe would be given a deadline to respond to this new proposal, the terms of which would be lower than the one in 2022. According to sources familiar with those previous talks — like all sources cited in this article, they preferred to speak anonymously to protect relationships — Mbappe was offered a six-season contract with a €130million signing bonus and a salary of €26m a year.AdvertisementMbappe took a first step of his own on January 3 when, without consulting PSG, he stopped to speak with reporters after PSG beat Toulouse in the Trophee des Champions — a game between the previous season’s winners of Ligue 1 and the French Cup, much like the Community Shield in England.“In 2022, I didn’t know my decision until May,” Mbappe said in reply to questions about his future — it being the start of a new year, he was now into the final six months of his contract and free to negotiate with interested clubs.“If I know what I want to do, I shouldn’t let the decision drag on. It wouldn’t make any sense.”Meanwhile, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said the club wanted him to stay: “He is the best player in the world, and the best thing for him is PSG. He is at the heart of the project. I ask everyone to leave Kylian in peace.”Mbappe with his Trophee des Champions winner’s medal (Christian Liewig – Corbis/Getty Images)Mbappe’s words were interpreted positively in the Spanish capital, where Madrid were already working on the detail of their offer. When what they were proposing reached the player’s entourage in the following days, the club made it known that his salary (the offer was for slightly more than Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were getting) and signing fee would make him their best-paid player.Perez was in regular contact with Mbappe during this process, something that is unusual for Madrid’s club president. Ordinarily, his right-hand man, their director general Jose Angel Sanchez, conducts negotiations. Mbappe told Perez he was keen on the move. All the while Madrid insisted, through briefings to the media, that they had no interest in the player. But the reality was quite different — as The Athletic reported on numerous occasions.Sanchez travelled to Paris before Madrid took part in the four-club Supercopa de Espana tournament, which was played in Saudi Arabia from January 10-14. He returned full of optimism — another good sign, as he is usually cautious and very restrained.By the end of that month, everyone at Madrid believed a deal would be done. But still there was no definitive agreement. Some people close to Mbappe were not as clear on the move as he was.Perez, pictured at a Madrid game in January (Angel Martinez/Getty Images)As reported by The Athletic in mid-February, influential members of his entourage were unconvinced by the offer because it was below what he was making at PSG, and could earn from another potential suitor.In talks with Perez, the president outlined how signing for Madrid would take the player’s profile to another sporting and marketing level, which would help bring in further personal revenue. With a few exceptions such as Vinicius Jr, the split at Madrid over image rights is usually 50 per cent for the club and 50 per cent for the player, although the share for Mbappe is expected to be in his favour.AdvertisementSources at PSG still felt it was likely that Mbappe would leave. They recalled how he had already decided last summer against taking up an option to stay for an extra year, and knew he had repeatedly expressed admiration for Madrid.But these sources also explained that PSG felt “protected economically”. They described an agreement in principle with Mbappe that would see the club compensated financially if he did leave following the expiry of his contract on June 30. They said it was a complex arrangement that covered several scenarios — including the France captain waiving certain loyalty bonuses he might otherwise have been entitled to. Mbappe himself has also talked of “all parties being protected” when he leaves, and discussions on this aspect are still ongoing.It remains to be seen exactly what agreement, if any, Mbappe and PSG make in this regard. But the French champions have always sought to stress that any departure for the forward at the end of the 2023-24 season would not be a ‘free transfer’ in their eyes.Mbappe and Al-Khelaifi, pictured after PSG’s Coupe de France win (Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images)Then came a key development.On February 13, a Tuesday, Real Madrid played away against RB Leipzig in the first leg of a Champions League last-16 tie. Senior club figures travelled with inside information. They had been told Mbappe would inform PSG of his decision to depart at the end of the season.The news did not become public until the Thursday, but with the Madrid squad still in Germany, the club’s board informed head coach Carlo Ancelotti. Without being told whether or not Mbappe had actually signed a contract, the Italian was made to understand that he could count on having the striker in his squad for next season.About 10 days later, Mbappe was spotted on Spanish soil, but in Barcelona not Madrid, enjoying a few days off. One source told The Athletic he had gone to the capital first to sign his contract.AdvertisementOnly this week, in early June, did two more sources share further information on the February talks. They said this was when Mbappe’s move was sealed.The final stages of negotiations were conducted in utmost secrecy. Madrid do tend to operate this way, but sources involved in the deal also said Mbappe’s mother and agent Fayza Lamari requested there be no leaks at all, in order for her son to be as protected as possible during his final months with PSG.Mbappe scored 44 goals in 48 games for PSG last season (Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu via Getty Images)Some tensions between Mbappe and PSG followed, with manager Luis Enrique occasionally substituting him or leaving him out altogether. “We have to get used to playing without him,” the Spaniard said in March.After being replaced at half-time of a goalless draw away to Monaco, his first professional club, on March 1, Mbappe sat in the stands with his family instead of on the bench with team-mates. Watching the rest of the match just a few rows away were members of the PSG board, and reports said there was a heated conversation between them and his mum. Madrid and the player’s camp believe PSG penalised Mbappe by reducing his playing time. Sources at the French club dismiss this as untrue.The end was drawing near, but the fact both PSG and Madrid were still competing in the Champions League added to the strategy of total discretion. Three days after PSG were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals, however, Mbappe made his decision to leave public.“I need a new challenge after seven years,” he said, while thanking almost everyone at the club (most notably, Al-Khelaifi was not mentioned), but they did not know it was coming.Mbappe wanted to make the announcement before PSG’s final home game of the season on Sunday, May 12. The club decided not to organise anything special for him, but the team’s ultras (with whom Mbappe had shared a barbecue on the Friday) dedicated a huge tifo to him.The following Monday, newspaper Le Parisien reported that, in the run-up to the game, Al-Khelaifi and Mbappe had an argument, with the former reproaching the latter for not mentioning him in his farewell video.A PSG source strongly denied this happened, adding that an agreement with Mbappe over the economic terms of his departure was almost done.Later that Monday, Mbappe was named Ligue 1’s player of the year for a fifth consecutive season. In his acceptance speech, he did acknowledge Al-Khelaifi, who in 2021, 2022 and 2023 repeated that his star player would not leave PSG for free.Advertisement“The new chapter will be very exciting,” Mbappe said of his next move, without revealing the identity of his next club. “Maybe it’s not the time (for everyone) to find out.”The big reveal was always expected to come after the Champions League final, this past Saturday. Madrid did not want anything, not even the biggest signing they have ever made, to distract attention from something so important and difficult to achieve.Early on Monday, two days after the club won a record-extending 15th European Cup/Champions League title, The Athletic reported the announcement would be made this week.Now it is finally done — and fans can excitedly look forward to seeing Mbappe in that famous white kit.Un sueño hecho realidad.Muy feliz y orgulloso de formar parte del club de mis sueños @realmadrid Es imposible explicar lo feliz y emocionado que me siento en este momento.

The market data provider Unusual Whales posted that there had been a spike in trading for those options.Adding fuel to the rally was a post to the X account associated with Mr. Gill that featured an image of a reverse card from Uno, the card game. Followers largely interpreted the picture — in line with the cryptic memes that punctuated Mr. Gill’s social media posts in 2021 — as a rallying cry to bolster GameStop’s stock price, which had fallen after a Roaring Kitty-inspired spike last month.;Left

Honda and Mazda Motor said they, too, had identified problems related to the testing of several models.The automakers, which the Japanese government had told to open the investigations, said the testing failures would not affect the performance or safety of their vehicles and that customers could continue to use them normally. Still, Toyota said it would temporarily halt shipments of three of the affected models it produces in Japan. Mazda said it would suspend sales of two Japan models.The testing problems revealed Monday by Toyota, Honda and Mazda were conducted in Japan to meet the Japanese government’s certification standards.

An engraved silver belt buckle, apparently.Simone Biles earned the Texas token as a trophy Sunday night after clinching the top spot at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships with a total score of 119.750 (60.450 on Day 1, 59.300 on Day 2). She also swept every individual event title.AdvertisementOver two nights, the 27-year-old’s biggest mistake was over-rotating her Yurchenko double pike vault and landing on her back. Even with the fall, she still earned a 15.000 because the vault is so difficult and Biles executed it with little flaw aside from the landing.She began on the balance beam with a solid routine for a 14.800 and added a 15.100 on floor exercise. Though she had a bit too much juice on her triple-twisting double back tuck and bounced out of bounds, she incurred only minor landing deductions for her other three über difficult tumbling passes.Biles capped her winning all-around performance on the uneven bars, coasting through in her typical speedy fashion to score a 14.400.Amidst her historic night, Biles found time to boost up a fellow Olympic all-around champion after Suni Lee opened the night with a fall on vault. Lee competed a double-twisting vault Friday and warmed it up Sunday but didn’t get enough height off the vault table to complete two twists due to her hand slipping when performing the vault in competition.She managed 1 1/2 twists and sat the vault down, similar to the incomplete vault Biles did during team finals in Tokyo when struggling with the twisties. Lee wasn’t injured but stepped off the competition floor to gather herself after the fluke vault, and Biles found her to offer some support.“After Suni vaulted, I knew exactly what was going through her head. I dealt with that in Tokyo so I just knew that she needed some encouragement and somebody to trust her gymnastics for her and to believe in her, so that’s exactly what I did,” Biles said, adding that Lee asked her to stand by the uneven bars during her next routine after vault.AdvertisementLee righted the ship with a 14.500 on bars for a routine that does not yet include the full difficulty she plans to show at Olympic Trials and landed in fourth in her first all-around competition back since 2021. Following the meet, she credited Biles for helping her stay grounded after the vault fall.“She’s been one of my biggest inspirations for a long time. I know that we’re kinda teammates and competitors, but she’s somebody that I look up to so to hear those words coming from her means a lot,” Lee said.Skye Blakely held on to her second-place position with another strong showing, highlighted by a 14.450 on bars. The 19-year-old has struggled with consistency issues when competing internationally, but with the debut of an upgraded vault and eight hit routines over both nights of competition, she strengthened her case for making the Paris Olympic team.Tokyo silver medalist Jordan Chiles climbed to fifth in the all-around standings behind a big 14.100 floor routine while 2020 floor Olympic gold medalist Jade Carey finished seventh. Both recorded falls on beam, but they weren’t alone. The four-inch event gave multiple gymnasts trouble Sunday, as Paris contender Leanne Wong also fell.Sixteen gymnasts earned an invite to Olympic Trials, slated for June 27-30 in Minneapolis, where they will compete for a spot on the five-person squad headed to Paris. Among the field are Shilese Jones and Kaliya Lincoln, who withdrew from championships but successfully petitioned to Trials.In the men’s competition, Brody Malone won his third national all-around title and took first on high bar Saturday night in his first competition back after a devastating knee injury in March 2023 that required three surgeries.SECURING THE WIN. 🙌 Brody Malone closes out the weekend and secures his third U.S. all-around title! #XfinityChamps pic.twitter.com/XSwh0HQ0Mm — NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) June 2, 2024The 24-year-old, who had to relearn how to walk after suffering a tibial plateau fracture, a partially torn PCL and a fully torn LCL, is on track to make his second Olympic team this summer alongside Michigan’s Frederick Richard and Stanford’s Khoi Young.

Sign up here to find us in your inbox once a month, and to receive our weekly T List newsletter. Have a question? You can always reach us at tlist@nytimes.com.Roughly halfway between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the coastal town of Paraty (population 45,000) isn’t the easiest place to reach. It requires a four-hour, mostly mountainous drive from either city, a 45-minute helicopter charter or arrival by sea. It’s that relative seclusion that keeps the tourist hordes and unbridled development at bay, despite the town’s obvious appeal. Set on Brazil’s Costa Verde, with mountains covered in rainforest on one side and the emerald green waters of Ilha Grande Bay on the other, Paraty (pronounced para-CHEE by locals), preserves more than 30 blocks as its historic quarter, a grid of pedestrian-only cobblestone streets lined with whitewashed 18th- and 19th-century facades, many of them remnants of the Portuguese colonial era.Starting in the mid-1600s, the town grew prosperous as a seaport during the country’s gold rush (many of the biggest gold mines were in the neighboring inland state Minas Gerais) — and as a hub for the slave trade. African slaves not only worked in the mines but built much of the town’s early infrastructure, such as its roads. Once the gold stopped coming through Paraty for export in the early 1700s, the town continued to harvest sugar cane and produce cachaça, the national spirit, before shifting its economic focus to the coffee trade. At the end of the 19th century, Santos, 190 miles to the south, supplanted Paraty as the country’s primary coffee-exporting port, and the town began to languish. “It fell off the map,” says Luana Assunção, the owner of the Rio-based travel company Free Walker Tours. “It became isolated and poor. Many houses were abandoned.”By the 1970s, a new highway and an influx of urban transplants had given Paraty an infusion of new life. Lured by the area’s affordability, a number of artists, designers and other creative types began renovating the old mansions and opening a handful of galleries, boutiques, cafes and small hotels, turning the long-forgotten town into an alluring vacation destination.“I was worried that mass tourism would endanger the future of the culture and the nature in Paraty, but it didn’t happen,” says the nature photographer Dom João de Orleans e Bragança, who has been visiting Paraty since 1968 and now lives there most of the year. He credits the strict building codes for imbuing the town with a certain timeless quality, even after the pandemic when the area’s second-home owners began spending more time in Paraty. “You’ll never see a skyscraper, and we don’t have big resorts or hotels here.”;Left

This simple version of arroz chaufa (fried rice) focuses on chicken thighs and red bell pepper, but other varieties might embrace sliced hot dogs, shrimp or strips of meat. The key to this recipe, and other fried rice recipes, is keeping the cooking surface hot. This is easy to achieve when using a powerful wok burner in a professional kitchen, but at home, this means cooking things in smaller batches. If you need to serve more people, multiply the recipe as needed, but make sure to cook the rice in several batches to allow it to crisp rather than steam.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl, increase speed to high and beat until billowy and whipped, about 2 more minutes. Transfer to the cooled crust and spread in an even layer.

Since garlic chips can burn easily, the key here is to combine the garlic and oil in an unheated pan for even cooking. As the oil heats up, the garlic will sizzle rapidly as the moisture cooks off. When it slows down, the garlic slices should be crisp. Be sure to remove the chips just as they begin to turn golden, as they will continue to cook after being removed from the oil. The rest is easy: Sauté the eggplant, create a quick soy sauce glaze, sprinkle with herbs and garlic chips, and serve.;Left

Nuoc cham works as a salad dressing, too. Here we drizzle it on crisp cucumbers and radishes, but sliced ripe tomatoes work just as well.

Silky soft tofu is draped in a punchy soy dressing, creating a lively dish with little effort. The tofu is ideally served cold, but 10 minutes at room temperature can take the edge off. Make it your own with other fresh herbs such as Thai basil, mint or shiso leaves, or add crunch with fried shallots or roasted peanuts. A salty, fermented element like kimchi, pickled radish or ja choi, also known as zha cai, a Sichuan pickled mustard root, would work well, too. One block of silken tofu is usually enough to feed two people, but for a more substantial meal, serve it with hot rice or noodles to create a pleasing contrast of temperatures.To get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for The Veggie newsletter .;Left

(A grater with wide holes works best here for dramatic shavings.) If the soft bed of cheese is the protagonist, then the fresh herbs are the supporting characters that give this salad verve. Use tarragon if you have it and love it, but basil works, too. There is no dressing to make — just toss oil and vinegar through the greens.

But this Nickelodeon-green variation on the Genoan classic, from the chef Meliano Plasencia of Da Andrea in New York City, achieves a velvety sheen thanks to a couple of tricks: A high-powered blender aerates the mixture, leaving behind the smoothest emulsion. (A food processor won’t achieve the same results but they’ll still taste delicious.) Ice cubes prevent the basil from heating up and oxidizing. The pine nuts in Mr. Plasencia’s original recipe, which won second place in a pesto invitational back in 1985, have been nixed in recent years to accommodate diners with allergies. Without the nuts, this pesto tastes of pure basil. If skipping the seafood, you could up the pasta to one pound, or refrigerate any leftover pesto, an instant soup or sandwich flavor booster, in an airtight container for up to 3 days. —Eric Kim;Left

Half the zucchini is thinly sliced into rounds, fried then steeped in red wine vinegar for a sweet and sour kick. The remaining zucchini is cut into large chunks and braised until it’s so silky that it seems to melt into the pasta sauce. Cooking the pasta directly in its sauce takes a little more attention than usual, especially toward the end of cooking when the liquid reduces to a sauce, so be sure to stir frequently to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot. This one-pot cooking approach allows all the starch released from the pasta to be captured in the sauce, creating a rich, glossy coating without the addition of dairy.

174;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/46-how-to-use-an-instant-pot;How to Use an Instant Pot;How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers — stovetop and electric — are quite safe. They don’t explode as your grandmother’s may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, they’re heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pot’s temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isn’t hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cook’s having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And don’t worry: It won’t explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.;Left

178;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fauci-denies-seeking-suppress-covid-19-lab-leak-origin-theory;Fauci denies seeking to suppress COVID-19 lab leak origin theory;Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Monday denied attempting to suppress the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic began as a result of a lab leak in Wuhan, China, during his opening statement before the House Oversight Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic.Lawmakers proceeded to grill Fauci throughout the hearing on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions six-feet distancing rule, the masking of schoolchildren and other pandemic-era restrictions.Fauci testified affirmatively each time when asked by Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, if business closures, church closures, school closures and stay at home order were justified, adding that again, this was when we were trying to stop the tsunami of deaths that were occurring early on – how long you kept them going is debatable.Asked again about mask mandates, including those for children under the age of 5, Fauci said those were in the context of the time when 5,000 people a day were dying.HIGH-RANKING FAUCI ADVISER USED PERSONAL EMAIL TO AVOID FOIA REQUESTS, DISCUSS COVID ORIGINMask mandates for children under the age of five? There’s scientific evidence supporting that? the congressman asked.There was no study that did masks on kids before, Fauci admitted. You couldn’t do the study. You had to respond to an epidemic that was killing 4-5,000 Americans a day.Fauci also attempted to clarify an earlier statement that the six-foot social distancing rule just appeared, telling committee members that it actually came from the CDC.The CDC was responsible for those kinds of guidelines for schools, not me. So when I said that, it just appeared. It appeared. Was there any science behind it? What I meant by no science behind it is that there wasnt a controlled trial. That said, compare six foot with three feet with ten feet. So there wasnt that scientific evaluation of it. What I believe the CDC used for their reason to say six feet is that studies years ago showed that when youre dealing with droplets, which at the time that the CDC made that recommendation, it was felt that the transmission was primarily through droplet, not aerosol, which is incorrect because we know now aerosol does play a role. Thats the reason why they did it. It had little to do with me since I didnt make the recommendation.Fauci also defended vaccine mandates for students, employees and the military by stating, Vaccines save lives. It is very, very clear that vaccines have saved hundreds of thousands of Americans and millions worldwide.In the beginning, it clearly prevented infection in a certain percentage of people but the durability of its ability to prevent infection was not long. It was measured in months, he added.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., pressed Fauci on past comments he made during an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation, when he claimed that those who criticize him are really criticizing science because I represent science. At the time, the remark drew ire, getting slammed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who accused him of having a delusion of grandeur that you cannot criticize him.Elon Musk also criticized Fauci, posting on social media, Anyone who says that questioning them is questioning science itself cannot be regarded as a scientist.Asked Monday if he represents science, Fauci testified, I am a scientist who uses the scientific method to gain information.In his opening statement, Fauci addressed the COVID-19 lab leak theory. stressing to the committee that he never sought to suppress that idea.He testified that on Jan. 31, 2020, he was informed through phone calls with Jeremy Farrar, then director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK, and then with Kristian Anderson, a highly regarded scientist at Scripps Research Institute, that they and Eddie Holmes, a world-class evolutionary biologist from Australia, were concerned that the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus could have been manipulated in a lab.The next day, Fauci said, he participated in a conference call with about a dozen international virologists to discuss this possibility versus a spillover from an animal reservoir. Fauci described the conference call discussion as lively with arguments for both possibilities, and said two participants have testified before the House subcommittee that he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction.FAUCI ADVISERS ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF COVID ORIGIN DOCS MUST BE PROBED BY AG: RAND PAULIt was decided that several participants would more carefully examine the genomic sequence after this further examination. Several who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated. They concluded that the most likely scenario was the spillover from an animal reservoir, although they still kept an open mind, Fauci said. They appropriately published their opinion in the peer-reviewed literature.The accusation being circulated that I influenced these scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false and simply preposterous. I had no input into the content of the published paper, Fauci said in his opening statement. The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Republican-led subcommittee has spent over a year probing the nation’s response to the pandemic and whether U.S.-funded research in China may have played any role in how it started. Democrats opened the hearing saying the investigation so far has found no evidence that Fauci did anything wrong, while missing an important opportunity to prepare for the next scary outbreak.Fauci spent 14 hours over two days in January being grilled by the House panel behind closed doors. Mondays hearing was the first time Fauci was questioned in public and on camera since he ended more than five decades of government service.The Associated Press contributed to this report.;Right

Maher conceded that he could be persuaded in the other direction if presented with a good argument in support of a potential Biden victory.Swisher estimated there was a silent majority of voters — particularly female voters — who would never vote for Trump, and would back Biden in November as the less problematic candidate.Maher said that prediction was an absolutely possible scenario but he couldnt place bets either way.However, he argued theres an equal likelihood that the shy Trump voter gives the former president an edge over Biden.The shy Trump voter is the one whos going to vote for Trump, but doesnt want you to know it because its a little déclassé, he said, predicting this trend would be seen on Election Day even in deep blue cities.BILL MAHER, BILL BURR HAVE TENSE EXCHANGE OVER ISRAEL: ‘WHY AM I F-----G LISTENING TO YOU?’Maher also addressed his critics on the left whove said hes changed over the years because of his reputation for calling out the woke left.Thats so much more about them, he told Swisher of his liberal critics. Thats so much more about being locked in your tribal silo.That’s not who I’m working to anymore, he continued, adding that these people have to fit into a trope.During an appearance on The View last month, co-host Sunny Hostin clashed with Maher about the Democratic Party shifting to the far left on issues like Israel.After he identified himself as an old-school liberal, Hostin bluntly told Maher, youve changed.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPDespite the clash with Hostin, he had high praise for the show and its co-hosts during the podcast.I loved it, he told Swisher. I think we all got along great.After Swisher joked he was very well-behaved on the ABC show, Maher reiterated that he was able to get his points across while staying civil.;Right

Judge Noreika said its possible a full jury could be seated today.Currently in the pool are is a woman who said she has strong feelings about the case, and has also followed the separate tax evasion case against the presidents son. She was also aware of the attempted bargain that fell through with the prosecution and Hunter Biden and understands thats why we are here today. She said that she could be fair and impartial based on what she knew. Her feelings about guns were that there should be background checks and limits on access for assault rifles. The judge kept her in the pool over objections from the defense on impartiality grounds.Also in the pool is a former Delaware police officer who said he believed the FBI prosecutes over politics and specifically mentioned the Steele Dossier and the trial against former President Donald Trump in New York. He said he once supported a candidate that challenged Beau Biden in the race for attorney general.Another potential juror in the pool testified that they own four firearms and have concealed carry permits in three states.Fox News Aubrie Spady and James Levinson contributed to this update.;Right

The trial stems from federal gun charges brought against him by special counsel David Weiss.Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to federal gun charges in U.S. District Court for Delaware after Weiss charged him with making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a licensed firearm dealer, and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.With all counts combined, the total maximum prison time for the charges could be up to 25 years. Each count carries a maximum fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release.The trial begins nearly a year after presiding Judge Maryellen Noreika questioned a plea deal between prosecutors and Hunter Biden, which subsequently fell apart.JUDGE BARS PROSECUTORS FROM USING SOME SALACIOUS EVIDENCE IN HUNTER BIDENS GUN TRIALThe agreement, blasted as a sweetheart deal by congressional Republicans, appeared to convey broad immunity to the presidents son on a host of potential criminal charges.According to an indictment, Hunter Biden bought a Colt Cobra revolver Oct. 12, 2018, and knowingly made a false and fictitious written statement, intended and likely to deceive that dealer with respect to a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale of the firearm … certifying he was not an unlawful user of, and addicted to, any stimulant, narcotic drug, and any other controlled substance, when in fact, as he knew, that statement was false and fictitious.The indictment also charges Hunter Biden with possessing that gun, which was shipped and transported in interstate commerce, for nearly a week despite being addicted to narcotics.HUNTER BIDEN IS IN COURT IN DELAWARE. HERES WHAT HE DOESNT WANT THE JURY TO HEARFox News first reported in 2021 that police had responded to an incident in 2018, when a gun owned by Hunter was thrown into a trash can outside a market in Delaware.A source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News it indicated that Hallie Biden, who is the widow of President Bidens late son, Beau, and who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter in a dumpster behind a market near a school.Hallie Biden may be required to testify during Hunter Bidens trial.A firearm transaction report reviewed by Fox News indicated Hunter purchased a gun earlier that month.On the firearm transaction report, Hunter answered in the negative when asked if he was an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.Hunter was discharged from the Navy in 2014 after testing positive for cocaine.HUNTER BIDEN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL GUN CHARGES OUT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL DAVID WEISS PROBEJudge Noreika ruled ahead of the trial that Weiss’s team cannot use some salacious evidence in the first son’s criminal trial, including references to the Navy discharge and his child support case for his out-of-wedlock daughter in Arkansas.Noreika also said Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.Noreika said the government may use part of Hunter Bidens book in which he discusses his addiction to drugs.The prosecution does not plan to bring out the entire infamous laptop containing details of Hunter Bidens life but will introduce certain portions. Noreika ruled that Hunter Biden’s team will be able to question aspects of the laptop in front of the jury. The laptop, which leaked in 2020 just before the presidential election, was decried as Russian disinformation by 51 former intelligence officials.Noreika also ruled that the special counsel cannot mention Hunter Bidens pending federal tax trial in California during the trial in Delaware, which is also part of Weisss investigation and scheduled for a September trial.Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges — specifically, three felonies and six misdemeanors concerning $1.4 million in owed taxes that have since been paid. Weiss alleged a four-year scheme when the president’s son did not pay his federal income taxes from January 2017 to October 2020 while also filing false tax reports.HUNTER BIDEN TAX TRIAL POSTPONED TO SEPTEMBERJudge Mark Scarsi heard arguments during a pre-trial hearing in California last month. That criminal trial was scheduled for June 20, but Hunter Biden’s attorneys requested to delay the trial.Scarsi sided with Hunter Biden’s attorneys, and moved the tax trial to Sept. 5, when jury selection will begin.;Right

Hes even mentioned civil war at one point, talked about there would be bloodshed, Waters said on MSNBC Sunday, referring to Trumps rhetoric.During the media appearance, the congresswoman vowed that she would ask the criminal justice system to find out what is going on with the domestic terrorists, seeming to refer to the presumptive Republican nominees supporters.Are they preparing a civil war against us? she continued.

Joining this alliance is often a sign of corruption, radicalization and even exploitation by outside actors, he added.Rev.

Smith, Monica McNutt, Shannon Sharpe and even host Molly Qerim offering their opinions on the matter.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMSmith said he believed there were WNBA players who were jealous of the attention Clark has received since entering the league and suggested race may play a part in it.There are girls – young ladies – in the WNBA who are jealous of Caitlin Clark. She is a White girl that has come into the league, Smith said. She has bursted onto the scene. She hasn’t proven herself yet. It’s not even about them thinking they’re better than her because they probably know it at this particular juncture because they’ve been playing on a level she just arrived to.Where the resentment comes in is the hard work, the commitment, the dedication, the pounding of the pavement, the being on the grind all of these years trying to uplift this brand that is the WNBA and is women’s professional basketball and all of their efforts were in vain until this girl comes along and takes the league by storm, takes the sport by form in college and has accomplished in a short period of time what they haven’t been able to.One would think that folks would be smart enough to recognize and appreciate that about Caitlin Clark – piggyback off of that to their benefit and praise her and support her for it while competing on the court against her.2024 WNBA ODDS: WILL TURMOIL AFFECT CAITLIN CLARKS ROOKIE OF THE YEAR CAMPAIGN?Smith said he wasn’t necessarily concerned with Carter’s history or even overblowing the particular play she was involved in. He wanted to put all of it into context.You do that to a person who is now the face of the WNBA, you know that there’s something a little extra to that. Now, in fairness to her, I’ve seen a report where it showed Caitlin Clark elbowing her first and it was retaliatory – I get that part. Let’s also remember that before she shoved, she hip-checked her from the back, from behind, she called her the B-word.… We get all of that. That’s in the heat of competition. We’re not going to overblow that.What we’re going to do is give the level of appreciation that it deserves in terms of the venom and potential hostility that exists toward this ‘golden girl’ who happens to be White and how the WNBA is promoting her.Carter’s foul was upgraded on Sunday from a common foul to a flagrant-1 violation.

197;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.outkick.com/sports/11-teams-so-far-decline-bow-pride-month-messaging-around-nfl;11 NFL Teams So Far Decline To Bow To Pride Month Messaging;The calendar flipped to June over the weekend and, in case you missed it, that makes it pride month on television and radio, in your stores, everywhere on the internet, on your streets, up your flagpoles, in your classrooms (like it or not), and at least one other place:Throughout most of the NFL.The practice of men sleeping with men, women sleeping with women, some men becoming women and some women becoming men – with the folks who say they are now neither men nor women also included – was celebrated by about two-thirds of the NFLs teams on Saturday via social media.Majority Of NFL Teams For Pride MonthThe message, delivered on X via team timelines, was sent by 21 of the NFLs 32 teams to their approximate 42 million total followers.Some teams tweeted out their support that pride month has arrived. Some delivered expanded messages as part of that support.The Washington Commanders, for example, said pride month is actually about love.And some teams sent tweets and went the extra step by altering their logos or X banners.The Commanders, Buffalo Bills, and Philadelphia Eagles changed the color of their logos to match a pride flag.Some Teams REALLY Are For Pride MonthThe Vikings not only tweeted out their support and changed their logo but also changed the banner of the X account. They are apparently very excited about pride month.The Eagles took an interesting tact in that they didnt deliver their message of support in a full-blown tweet. But they did change their logo on X, which makes their support obvious.The NFL?It advances the LGBTQ+ agenda. It hosts an annual gala with GLAAD and promotes other gay community events.But the NFL didnt tweet its support for pride month on June 1, instead retweeting the Chicago Bears and Jaguars tweets.By the way, the comments sections after the tweets from the various teams are as one would expect. The comments paint a visceral difference of opinion on the message about the month-long celebration.Support For Gay Agenda Is WidespreadAll of that, by the way, is dog bites man. If this were 1970-to-perhaps 2010 there would be no outward support of a pride month by the NFL on a national scale. But it has been growing seemingly inexorably for perhaps a dozen years or more.So, to no surprise, teams are sending messages that theyre for pride month in 2024.The man bites dog factor, on the other hand, is seen when teams either oppose pride month or say nothing about it.And for claritys sake, let it be known that no team has said it opposes pride month.It is clear that many within the NFL – and society – dont like pride month for varying reasons. Some people dont abide with or agree with the gay lifestyle or agenda.And some, while having no issues with gay people whatsoever, simply dont like pride month being so ubiquitous, as if being shoved down peoples throats. These people would recoil if, say, a month-long puppy or a straight people celebration was shoved down their throats every year, too.Regardless, in todays world, mere silence is often deemed as both support or opposition by radicals on opposite sides.So be warned here: Reporting what teams did not tweet an announcement joining the pride month support and celebrations is dispassionate. It does not convey opposition.It merely conveys what it is: Silence.11 NFL Teams Do Not ParticipateOver the weekend, 11 NFL teams chose not to tweet or acknowledge pride month. The 11 teams are:The Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, Tennessee Titans, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos, Dallas Cowboys, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints, and Atlanta Falcons.All the teams in two NFL divisions – the AFC East and NFC West – tweeted support for pride month.One division – the AFC North – had three of four teams stay silent on the topic, with Baltimore embracing pride month.Three divisions – the AFC West, NFC North and NFC South – spilt among the four teams, with two supporting and two teams remaining silent.And why does this matter? Two reasons:Firstly, when teams take different approaches to the same issue, the accounting is newsworthy. So what direction teams took is newsworthy.Finally, the United States is divided. There are lines drawn in politics. Liberalism and conservatism are at odds. There is a culture war being waged.And, yes, sometimes participants cross lines. Years ago, President Obama and President Biden stated they defined marriage as between a man and a woman. President Trump told 60 Minutes hes fine with gay marriage in 2016.Despite this, Obama and Biden are classified as being pro-gay marriage and Trump is often assailed as being against it.There can be no question 21 NFL teams are apparently in favor of it. And the other 11 are silent on the subject.;Right

According to the Washington Post, a carpenter in Virginia was integral to helping police crack the case.The carpenter, whose name has not been released, was determined to catch the suspects involved after having his vans broken into twice.

They steal our job.Police confirmed that a tracking device was used in the investigation in a press release.During the investigation, which began in late January when a tracking device in a stolen tool led officers to a storage unit in Elkridge, detectives have conducted search warrants at 12 locations – 11 of which are in Howard County – from where they recovered the tools, the statement reads.Detectives believe the tools were stolen from retail stores, businesses, vehicles, residential properties, and construction sites primarily in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, police added. The stolen tools were mostly kept in storage units in Howard County and detectives believe they were sold at a variety of locations and through different means.AUSTRALIAN TRAVELERS WARN ABOUT APPLE AIRTAG TRACKER PLACED IN LUGGAGE IN BALI: REPORTSo far, no suspects have been charged. Police said the theft case has around 80 victims, and authorities urge them to contact police to retrieve their stolen items.Howard County Police Chief Gregory Der thanked his officers for working on the case.This case sends a clear message: We will not tolerate criminal enterprises operating here in Howard County, Der said.

204;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxbusiness.com/fox-news-tech/nvidias-jensen-huang-promises-new-computing-age-led-taiwanese-tech-companies;Nvidia’s Jensen Huang promises new computing age led by Taiwanese tech;TAIWAN – Lifelike digital humans that will serve as everything from your nurse to your interior decorator. Virtual fashion models. A digital simulation of the entire earth.Those were just a few of the products and ideas floated by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his keynote address at the 2024 Taipei International Information Technology Show, better known as Computex. Huang enthralled a packed house with the claim that the world has entered a new industrial revolution.In the future, Taiwan will build computers that walk, Huang said as he showed images of nine humanoid robots and several wheeled robots while emphasizing that this robotic future is already here.The possibilities are endless, he said. Artificial Intelligence will create AI teams with an agent that interacts with you. The agent, however, is a combination of dozens of different types of generative AIs. Artificial intelligence that masters the laws of physics. A new computer board with a chip called Blackwell so fast it makes a mockery of Moore’s Law.In a talk that lasted nearly two hours, Huang spoke passionately about how radically different the generative computing era will be from the past. Much of the tech talk was incomprehensible to non-experts, but the overall message was clear: the computing world has been mostly running on ideas that are 60 years old. But, after 20 years of work in collaboration with other Taiwanese tech giants such as TSMC, Nvidia and its partners have reinvented the computing wheel. No more info retrieval. Instead, when you want info, it will be generated – thus being more relevant and up-to-date than anything that can be found.Huang showed off four new AI laptops, and spoke about the next wave of AI: Physical AIs. These will include robots that learn in a virtual world that simulates the laws of physics, teaching the robot to flawlessly act in the real world. In the future, anything that moves will be automated, said a voiceover in one of the videos Huang showed. But he stressed that the future isn’t some abstract idea, noting that everything he had shown is currently in development. Huang spoke of robotic factories being created in Taiwan now by companies such as Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics maker.Watching Huang’s presentation offered a great deal of validation to the fears that AI and robots will take or replace human jobs, and perhaps humans themselves. But Huang sees a bright future as we break free of CPUs and enter a tectonic shift that includes something called the omniverse.MOST AMERICANS EXPECT AI ABUSES TO IMPACT 2024 ELECTION: SURVEYHuang is immensely popular in Taiwan. Since he arrived in Taipei on May 26 he’s been hounded by packs of somewhat aggressive reporters. When leaving a dinner with some of the richest tech titans on the planet, Huang hopped into a regular yellow taxicab, not some chauffeured limo.FORMER OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHY SAM ALTMAN WAS OUSTED LAST NOVEMBERLocal newspapers use terms like rockstar to describe him, while another common comparison is to Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Huang understands the power of a look, almost always wearing his trademark black leather jacket, despite temperatures in Taiwan this time of year hovering around 85 degrees.Jobs, however, was called difficult by even close friends and had a reputation for being somewhat aloof and inaccessible. In this regard, Huang couldn’t be more different. He’s self-deprecating, especially about his language skills, despite apparently being relatively fluent in Mandarin Chinese. During the Computex presentation, he told the crowd he’d like to speak in Chinese but that his brain couldn’t run that fast so he’d stick to English, which he mostly did while getting in plenty of well-timed Chinese one-liners as well as several sentences in Taiwanese (or Hokkien, a local language spoken by some 70% of Taiwanese).ELON MUSKS XAI GETS $6B IN NEW FUNDING AND ANNOUNCES VALUATIONHuang ended his address with a tribute to Taiwan, the unsung hero of the coming AI industrial revolution. His praise for his birthplace of Taiwan was, of course, popular with the crowd and those watching the livestream of the event, but Huang has used both words and deeds to demonstrate his sincerity.Just before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at a Saturday game between two of Taiwan’s professional baseball teams, Huang told the media, This is a very exciting time for Taiwan… We are at the beginning of a new age of computing, the age of AI, and Taiwan is at the center.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREHuang has repeatedly touted the overachieving, underappreciated nation of Taiwan.Taiwan is one of the most important countries in the world. It is at the center of the electronics industry.

205;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-states-best-economies-2024-worst;US states with the best economies in 2024 – and the worst;The United States has the largest economy in the world, and each of its states and territories play a part in keeping its massive engine running. The states with the largest populations also contribute the most to gross domestic product, but a new study from WalletHub looked under the hood to gauge additional indicators of performance and strength.The analysis released Monday compared all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on their economic activity, economic health, and innovation potential using 28 metrics, including change in GDP, unemployment rate and fiscal health, to determine which ones are pulling the most weight when it comes to moving the U.S. economy forward.Here are the states with the best economies in the nation right now, according to WalletHub:1. WashingtonThe state of Washington topped the list with the highest economic activity ranking and an extremely high amount of industry R&D investment per capita, according to the findings.INFLATION MEASURE CLOSELY WATCHED BY THE FED RISES 0.3% IN APRILWashington claims the top spot as the best state economy, driven by substantial investment in research and development, a high concentration of high-tech jobs, and a robust startup ecosystem, WalletHub analyst Cassandra Happe told FOX Business. These factors position Washington as a current leader and a future powerhouse in economic growth and innovation.2. UtahUtahs economy was ranked No. 2 thanks to its impressive economic health and labor market, Happe said.The Beehive State has the second-highest median annual household income in the nation after adjusting for the cost of living at nearly $84,000, and the average income in the state grew 6.8% between 2022 and 2023.RISING NATIONAL DEBT TO REDUCE AMERICANS INCOME GROWTH: REPORTUtah also has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, at 2.8%, along with the second-most growth in the civilian labor force.3. MassachusettsMassachusetts was credited with having the third-best state economy, which Happe said was propelled by significant R&D investments and a strong presence in high-tech industries and STEM employment.The Bay State excels in innovation, with the highest share of high-tech jobs and a leading number of patents per capita, Happe said. These attributes make Massachusetts a key player in driving the national economy forward.4. TexasIn fourth place, Texas benefits from a diverse and large economy with significant GDP growth and strong export activity despite lower innovation potential, the analysis found.HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD COST US COMPANIES $380B IN ‘SLOWLY UNFOLDING CRISIS’The Lone Star states economic activity index score was second-highest in the rankings, and it was seventh in economic health. But the state came in 24th for innovation potential.5. CaliforniaCalifornia landed the No. 5 spot for top state economies, which Happe said was reflective of its role as a major economic powerhouse with numerous tech firms and substantial R&D investments.However, she said, the state faces challenges in economic health due to high living costs and income inequality.US states with the worst economiesOn the other end of the spectrum, Louisiana, ranking 47th, struggles with high unemployment rates and low median household income, with minimal R&D investment hampering its economic growth prospects, Happe said.HOME INSURANCE RATES HAVE SURGED NEARLY 40% SINCE 2019 – BUT THEYRE RISING FASTEST IN THESE STATESMeanwhile, Arkansas, in 48th place, faces high poverty rates and limited high-tech job opportunities, impacting both economic health and innovation potential.West Virginia was ranked 49th, which the study said was due to its declining labor force and low GDP growth, compounded by the lowest innovation potential in the country.Hawaii was listed as No. 50, and Mississippi came in dead last at No. 51 in the rankings. Happe said those two states are among those facing significant economic challenges.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREThe Aloha State, which relies heavily on tourism, is burdened with high state debt and a lack of growth in key economic areas, while Mississippis struggles were attributed to its low median household income, high poverty rate, and minimal entrepreneurial activity.;Right

Ben Cardin in blue-state Maryland, last week urged Americans to respect the verdict and the legal process regardless of the outcome of former President Trump’s trial. The comment irked many Republicans and Lara Trump – the former president’s daughter-in-law – was asked if the RNC supported Hogan’s Senate bid after his remarks.I don’t support what he just said there. I think it’s ridiculous, and I think anybody who is not speaking up in the face of … a trial that would never have been brought against any other person aside from Donald Trump doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone, she said Sunday on CNN.REPUBLICANS SHUN BATTLEGROUND SENATE CANDIDATE URGING GOP TO ACCEPT TRUMP VERDICTHe doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party at this point, and quite frankly, anybody in America, if that’s the way you feel, she continued. That’s very upsetting to hear that.CNN host Kasie Hunt asked if that means the RNC is willing to cede the Senate seat in Maryland to Democrats instead of supporting Hogan.We, of course, want to win, as a party, but that is a shame and I think he should have thought long and hard before he said that publicly, Lara Trump said, adding that she isn’t sure if RNC resources will be used to help Hogan.As the Republican Party co-chair, I think he should have never of said something like that, she added. I think that’s ridiculous.Her remarks raised eyebrows given the significance of the Maryland race to winning the Senate majority in the 2024 congressional elections. A Republican in a blue state, Hogan was elected to two terms as governor, serving from 2015 to 2023. His victory in the Senate GOP primary turned what was viewed as a likely Democratic hold this year into a competitive general election race.Maryland hasnt voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988 and hasnt elected a Republican U.S. Senator since 1980.TRUMP SAYS GUILTY VERDICT IS A SCAR ON NEW YORK JUSTICE SYSTEM, VOWS TO KEEP FIGHTINGSenior Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita responded to Hogans X post last week, You just ended your campaign.Hogan has been critical of the former president and said earlier this year he wouldnt vote for him in 2024.Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree on Thursday after two days of jury deliberations in New York. The charges were related to a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, who says she was paid to remain silent about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006, which Trump denies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFox News Digital’s Brianna Herlihy and Hanna Panreck contributed to this report.;Right

The White House has called for additional reforms and funding from Congress.Republicans have blamed the policies of the administration, including the rollback of Trump-era policies such as wall construction, the Migrant Protection Protocols and increased interior enforcement.

The third-place car wins the race.Thats the way I see it. Its not like I went out there and took the lead away. But we were in position. One of our best-executed races so far this year with probably our best speed weve shown this year.The son of Team Penske president who won the 2022 Daytona 500 in his rookie season, Cindric entered the race 20th in the Cup standings and now has vaulted himself into the playoffs.Team executive vice president Walt Czarnecki said the team had not lost confidence in Cindric.He has not lost his desire, Czarencki said. This is a reaffirming situation, circumstance for him today. ... Weve never lost faith in Austin Cindric, I promise you.Takeaways after a race where following Cindric across the finish line were Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski, Tyler Reddick and Joey Logano.Cindric ValidationCindric didnt make the playoffs last year as he finished 24th in the standings and had just five top-10s after a rookie year in which he posted nine top-10s. The win Sunday was just his second top-10 of the season in a year where Team Penske struggled over the first few months.I dont want to find myself in a position to be okay with 10th and be, ‘OK, hey, I finished in the top 10, thats an awesome day. No, thats 10th, Cindric said. Thats good, thats a step forward, but its not where I want to be. Its not the level in which I prepare. Its not the level in which my team expects to perform.Thats not good enough to race and drive at Team Penske. I know that. No one has to tell me that. Theres no meeting that has to be set in place. I take that very personally.The victory marked the first points-race win for the organization in the 15 races this year. It looked like it would be Blaney over the final 15 laps until Blaney ran out of fuel.Going into the race today, I went to bed last night knowing Id be really, really disappointed if one of us didnt win, Cindric said. Im just happy that we were in position there when the 12 car [of Blaney] ran out, bring home a win because this team deserves it.I cant wait to see everybody back at the shop. Everyone has been super supportive, believing in me through good days and bad days.Bell, Blaney disappointmentThe two drivers who left flabbergasted they didnt win were Blaney and Bell.Blaney had no idea he was close on gas.Obviously, bummed for us — the nut shots keep coming here this past month, Blaney said. Hopefully it straightens itself out. Im proud of the effort. We have to figure out what happened there.

He was on older tires and trying to get us for a spot. Im not sure what that single point would mean for him, but it certainly hurt us a lot.It took that point away, as well as the others that we would get for the stage and then also the rest of the day. Its very frustrating. We cant afford days like that.Larson felt Busch pinched him a little but felt it was just hard racing — Ive got nothing bad to say about Kyle.We were coming to the end of that stage, and I was little better than him and [I went to] side-draft him and barely touched his quarter panel, Larson said. Im guessing it ticked him off and he squeezed into me. ... I guess he took the air off of me and [we] spun.Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

219;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-trump-face-similar-politicized-prosecutions-legal-expert-says;Netanyahu and Trump face similar politicized prosecutions, legal expert says;JERUSALEM – After a Manhattan jury on Thursday convicted former President Trump of falsifying business records, legal experts have commented on the similarities between his case and the ongoing prosecution of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Israel’s then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has flatly denied all the accusations against him.Fox News Digital reached out to leading legal experts who are well versed in the hard-charging and no-holds-barred electoral and judicial systems in both democracies.Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at George Mason University Scalia Law School and a scholar at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem think tank, told Fox News Digital, Israel has always been the canary in the coalmine for threats to freedom and Western democracy. The politicized prosecutions on obscure and incomprehensible charges and victimless crimes that has been used on President Trump greatly resemble the prosecutions of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israels situation is worse – Netanyahu was indicted four years ago after years-long investigations, making the prosecution a never-ending shadow on his political career.NETANYAHU INVITED TO ADDRESS CONGRESS AS BIDEN URGES HAMAS TO TAKE ISRAEL PEACE OFFERHe added Moreover, in Israel, prosecutors are not elected or even politically appointed, so there is not even the bitter consolation that both sides can play the same game.He continued, But in what could be a good omen for Trump, Netanyahus political opponents thought the multiple criminal proceedings would end his political career, but instead he has gone on to win multiple elections because voters stopped taking the prosecutions seriously.Modern politics is filled with examples of court systems turned into blunt instruments to railroad politicians and dissidents who upset political parties and opponents.NY V. TRUMP: DEFENSE SAYS PROSECUTORS DID NOT MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF, FORMER PRESIDENT IS INNOCENTPerhaps the most famous recent case is authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin’s imprisonment of his most potent political rival, Alexei Navalny, who was found dead in an Arctic penal colony in February. Putin’s critics claimed he was behind the killing. Russias opaque judiciary sentenced Navalny to a 19-year term for extremism. His defenders say he was persecuted by Putin because he was the first politician to build a national Russian opposition movement that seeks to end Putin’s more than two decades of control over Russia.In 2023, the late-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was found not guilty of witness tampering in connection with alleged sex parties, called bunga bunga,, at his villa in Milan. He claimed that his political enemies manufactured the sex scandal allegations.The controversial Italian politician died last year. He referred to himself as the Jesus Christ of politics. In 2013, however, Italys high court affirmed a conviction for tax fraud against Berlusconi.The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted as the country’s leader in 2022 and sentenced to multiple prison terms for corruption, including leaking state secrets. Khan argues that the cases against him are politically motivated and his supporters have filled the streets of the Southeast Asian country to protest his incarceration.Khan, a former cricket star who became an Islamist politician, is now facing 170 pending legal cases against him. The charges include terrorism, incitement to violence and graft. In March 2022, Khan claimed at a rally that a foreign conspiracy was working against him. He said a document showed that all will be forgiven if Imran Khan is removed from power. A month later, Khan was dislodged as prime minister by a no-confidence vote in the parliament.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerica’s former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is a lawyer, told Fox News Digital, The most important feature of a functioning democracy is its ability to instill confidence in the fairness of its judiciary. In the Trump case, the prosecution and the court have pursued a frivolous case and done enormous damage to our democracy. I am less familiar with the prime minister’s issues, but it is clear that in Israel there also exists a significant part of the population that is losing confidence in the judiciary.Friedman, who served during the Trump administration and played a key role in relocating the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem, added, This is always a byproduct of prosecuting political opponents. When done, the facts and the law must be compelling and even overwhelming. That’s clearly not present in either case.;Right

The doodles were found on a wall along Via dellAbbondanza, which was the main street of Pompeii.Pompeii is an ancient Roman city that was buried by volcanic ash during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD and largely remained hidden for centuries before it was officially rediscovered in the late 16th century.The charcoal drawings depict gladiators and hunters, and historians say that children were regularly exposed to violence in Roman amphitheaters. In a statement translated from Italian to English, archaeologists connected the violence that children witnessed in antiquity to gruesome images that children see today in popular media.Exposure to extreme forms of violence, even of young children (estimated between 5 and 7 years old), does not seem to be a problem only nowadays, between video games and social media, the organization said.WOMAN OUT FOR WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE-IN-A-DECADE DISCOVERYThe difference [is] that in antiquity, the blood spilled in the arena was real and that few saw it as a problem with all the possible repercussions on the psycho-mental development of children from Pompeii.In a video posted by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii on May 29, archaeologist Gabriel Zuchtriegel explained in Italian that the cartoons were found in a courtyard, where children likely played.MICHIGAN RESEARCHERS DISCOVER EERIE 1909 SHIPWRECK AT BOTTOM OF LAKE SUPERIORWe can imagine the children who played here for entire afternoons and had the possibility of making these drawings, perhaps unnoticed by the adults, on various parts of the walls where there was also a construction site where work was in progress on this house, he explained.Archaeologists collaborated with University of Naples Federico II to determine the significance of the images. Experts concluded that the images reflected what children saw in real life rather than in art or in their imaginations.We came to the conclusion that these drawings of gladiators and animal hunters were made after a direct vision of the facts, not after a pictorial model, Zuchtriegel said in a video that was later translated to English. And they are very young children of 6 or 7 years old, as can be seen from the human figures drawn as cephalopods, that is, the legs and arms that come directly out of the head. Even today, little children draw like this.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERIt is understood that here in Pompeii, even very young children were exposed to an extreme form of violence between men, between men and animals in the arena, in the amphitheater of the ancient city, the expert added.Thanks to the discovery, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said the drawings help to better understand childhood in the times of Ancient Romans.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APPFox News Digital reached out to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii for comment.;Right

As of Friday, more than 3,200 defendants did not have a public defender, according to data from the Oregon Judicial Department. Among those defendants, about 146 people were in custody, although a smaller number were expected to be impacted by Friday’s ruling, according to OPB.PROGRESSIVE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OUSTED BY TOUGH-ON-CRIME CHALLENGERIn March, a draft report from the Office of Public Defense Services found that Oregon needs 500 more attorneys to meet its obligations, according to OPB. State officials have attempted to address the issue, as well as providing additional funding, but structural issues still persist.Some changes are currently in progress, including hiring the first trial-level public defenders who are also state employees. And next year, the Oregon Public Defense Commission will move from the judiciary to the executive branch under the governor, a move state lawmakers hope will give the agency more support.The 9th Circuits decision upheld a preliminary injunction issued last year by U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane after 10 people in Washington County who were charged with crimes and held at the county jail while not having court-appointed attorneys filed a class action habeas corpus petition through the state’s federal public defenders office.Its an embarrassment to the state, McShane said during a hearing last August, when he indicated he would require the state to release defendants from custody if the state could not provide a public defender within seven days. Its a complete tragedy and nobody seems to have an answer. Literally, we suspended the Constitution when it comes to this group.Oregons federal public defender, Fidel Cassino-DuCloux, applauded Friday’s decision, saying in a statement that it breathes life into the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which have been an empty promise for too many presumptively innocent Oregonians charged with crimes.We hope that the state authorities heed the Ninth Circuit’s instruction that no one remains in jail without counsel and implements the decision without delay, Cassino-DuCloux wrote.Writing for the majority, Circuit Judge John Owens wrote Friday that the situation in Oregon violates a 60-year-old U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Gideon v. Wainwright, which found that anyone charged with a crime had a constitutional right to a defense lawyer, even if they cannot afford one.Yet, due to an ongoing public defense crisis of its own creation, Oregon does not provide indigent criminal defendants their fundamental right to counsel despite Gideon’s clear command, Owens wrote, adding that instead of making lawyers available to defendants, Oregon insisted on fighting the solution.In a dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Patrick Bumatay criticized McShanes injunction and the Ninth Circuit’s majority opinion as reckless and extreme and claimed the Ninth Circuit is now complicit in a judicial jailbreak.TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BANS MEDICAL EXCEPTIONSAnd those being released are not sitting there for some petty offense, Bumatay wrote. Just look at the charges of the named Petitioners here—they are accused of rape, kidnapping, strangulation, assaulting a police officer, public indecency, and burglary. All will now be released into Oregon’s communities.But Owens responded in the majority opinion, saying Bumatays dissent introduces new arguments and ignores the narrower question of whether McShane abused his considerable discretion when issuing the preliminary injunction, which Owens and Ninth Circuit Court Judge Salvador Mendoza ruled was not the case.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe dissents unbounded approach is an ode to classic judicial overreach, Owens wrote. It remains unclear why the dissent blames the district court for a ‘judicial jailbreak.’ Consistent with the Sixth Amendment, Oregon could solve this problem overnight simply by paying appointed counsel a better wage. It is Oregon, and not the district court, that created this crisis.A spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Justice told OPB that the department is reviewing the decision when asked if there would be an appeal.;Right
225;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/health/traveling-internationally-could-illegal-bring-medications-pharmacist;Traveling internationally? It could be illegal to bring along these medications, according to a pharmacist;As summer travel season gears up, 77% of Americans expect to pack a prescription medication for the trip — but nearly half don’t check to see whether it’s even legal to bring those meds into other countries.Additionally, more than a quarter of Americans have had medications confiscated during international travel, according to a May 2024 survey of 1,048 respondents by SingleCare, a free prescription savings service. Certain medications that are commonly prescribed in the United States might be illegal or strictly regulated in other countries, Dr. Jennifer Bourgeois, PharmD, a pharmacy and health expert based in Dallas-Fort Worth, told Fox News Digital.5 SECRET SUMMER-TRAVEL PACKING HACKS TO MAXIMIZE CARRY-ON SPACE AND MINIMIZE STRESSHere are some important details on this topic.4 types of medications that may be illegal for international travelGenerally, medications that have a high potential for abuse or dependency are more likely to face strict regulations, Bourgeois warned.These include controlled substances, which are tightly regulated because of their potential for addiction and misuse, she said.Stimulants, which are used for conditions such as ADHD and are considered illegal in some countries, are also included in that category.OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY COULD DOUBLE AS KIDNEY DISEASE TREATMENT, STUDY SUGGESTSBourgeois shared the following list of prescription drugs that may be illegal to transport across the border.No. 1: Narcotics and opioidsMedications such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and codeine are heavily regulated or banned in many countries due to their potential for abuse, according to Bourgeois.No. 2: Psychotropic drugsDrugs for mental health conditions, such as amphetamines (Adderall), benzodiazepines (Xanax) and certain antidepressants , may be restricted.No. 3: Medicinal cannabisEven if they are legal in some U.S. states, cannabis and cannabis-derived products are illegal in many countries, Bourgeois cautioned.No. 4: Strong painkillersSome countries restrict strong painkillers , such as tramadol, which is an opioid sold under the brand names ConZip and Ultram, to treat moderate to severe pain.How to check legality before travelingBringing prohibited medications into a foreign country can have the potential for serious consequences, such as confiscation of medications, fines and possible arrest, Bourgeois warned.UTAH MOM FIGHTS FOR HER DAUGHTER’S ACCESS TO DISCONTINUED DIABETES MEDICATION: ‘LIFE-SAVINGIn severe cases, travelers may be detained, prosecuted and even jailed.Legal issues can also lead to delays and complications in travel plans, she added.Before packing your prescriptions when traveling abroad, Bourgeois recommends checking your destination country’s embassy or consulate websites and laws regarding medication.You may also consult with your doctor, pharmacist or travel agent, who may be able to provide advice tailored to your destination , she added.If there are specific restrictions for your medication in the country you plan to visit, it’s best to follow the directions from the country’s embassy so you can continue to take your medication while traveling.Bringing prohibited medications into a foreign country can have the potential for serious consequences.For instance, many countries allow only a 30-day supply of certain medicines, and require that you carry a prescription or a medical certificate from your health care provider, said Bourgeois.If you know that you’ll need a refill of your prescription while you are away, check with your pharmacy two weeks before you leave.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends making an appointment with your health care provider or a travel health specialist at least one month before you leave, as stated on its website.The pharmacist may need to request refills or a ‘vacation override’ from your insurance , Bourgeois noted.If your medication is absolutely not allowed in the destination country, Bourgeois suggests consulting with your health care provider to discuss alternatives and potential adjustments to your treatment plan.What to know before packing prescriptionsEven if your medications are permitted in the country you’re visiting, it’s still important to follow some basic guidelines when traveling internationally, according to Bourgeois.First, it’s important to always have a copy of your prescription or a medical document signed by your doctor explaining why the medication is essential for you to have.Exceeding personal use quantities can raise suspicions.On its website, the CDC also recommends leaving a copy of your prescriptions at home with a family member or friend in case you lose your copy or need an emergency refill.SUMMER TRAVEL: HOW TO PACK A CARRY-ON (AND NOTHING MORE!) THIS VACATIONAlso, keep all medications in their original packaging to clearly display the prescription label, Bourgeois advised.Additionally, she said, make sure the name on the prescription matches the name on your passport.Carry only the quantity you need for the duration of your trip, plus a small buffer, Bourgeois said. Exceeding personal use quantities can raise suspicions.Also, be sure to declare your medications at customs if required by the destination country, she said.All medications should be kept in your carry-on luggage instead of in checked bags. That way, if there are unforeseen travel delays, you’ll still be able to access the medicine you need.5 additional medication travel tipsBourgeois shared the following additional things to consider when bringing medication across the border.No. 1: Keep time zones in mindTaking daily medications for chronic conditions can be confusing when you travel across the world, she cautioned.In severe cases, travelers may be detained, prosecuted and even jailed.Pay attention to time-zone differences and take the medication according to your last dose, not the local time of day.No. 2: Check OTC rulesIt is important to check your destination countrys laws for over-the-counter medications, too, Bourgeois said.For example, pseudoephedrine — commonly known as the brand drug Sudafed, which is purchased over the counter in the U.S. — is prohibited in Japan and Mexico.No. 3: Don’t buy from non-pharmacy sellersIf you are traveling internationally , don’t buy any medications that are not sold at the pharmacy, Bourgeois said.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERCounterfeit drugs are common in many developing countries and quality is not ensured.No. 4: Stock up on staplesBefore traveling, stock up on over-the-counter medications and travel-sized items from the pharmacy, said Bourgeois.Common over-the-counter medications for travel include antidiarrheals, motion sickness meds, allergy medicines and medications for pain and fever.No. 5: Understand disease risksIf you are traveling outside the U.S., it is important to understand the risk of diseases in the countries you plan to visit.Diseases such as Hepatitis A, yellow fever and typhoid can be prevented through vaccinations , Bourgeois said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTalk to your pharmacist about vaccine-preventable diseases and request a travel health consultation to ensure you are protected, she continued.It’s vital that you do not wait until the last minute to get your vaccinations, as it typically takes up to 14 days for antibodies to build.Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for comment.;Right
226;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-group-urges-gop-avoid-ostrich-strategy-target-dems-wanting-global-abortion-factory;Pro-life group urges GOP to avoid ostrich strategy, target Dems for wanting global abortion factory;Prominent pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America is urging Republican candidates not to stick their heads in the sand ahead of the 2024 elections, but rather paint Democrats as unpopular on abortion.Since the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision overturned nearly 50 years of precedent that effectively legalized abortion, Democrats have attributed political wins to the unpopularity of pro-life causes.But SBA said in a memo, sent to Republican leaders and committees Monday, that Democrats message is more fearmongering than fact, and it wants GOP candidates to emphasize that Democrats want to place America on a short list of the most pro-abortion countries in the world.HERE ARE THE TOP 4 MOMENTS FROM THE 2024 MARCH FOR LIFEThere are no protections for the unborn that Democrats can bring themselves to support, and they are consistently on the record opposing the protection of unborn babies when they can feel pain, even legislation to provide basic health care for a baby born alive after a failed abortion, the SBA memo says.Working with a pollster and former adviser to Trump, SBA says a winning message for Republican candidates involves stressing support for mothers at all stages of pregnancy and childbirth.The message that performed the strongest in moving voters is driving a strong contrast between Democrat support for the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) and GOP support for providing real options and support for mothers in need and opposition to the WHPA, SBA wrote. The research was conducted by Adam Schaeffer of Evolving Strategies, a behavioral science and political data firm.The WHPA passed the House in 2022, but failed in the Senate. Billed as a codification of Roe v. Wade, the measure goes beyond enshrining the 1973 abortion ruling and effectively would make it impossible to restrict abortion at any stage, according to SBA.In our test, the WHPA was characterized as sweeping federal legislation that would wipe away nearly all state limitations on abortion, even those that limit late-term abortions on healthy babies and ensure parental involvement when a young girl becomes pregnant, the SBA memo said.The other part of the winning message involved support for pregnant women and help for mothers – including expanding child tax credits.GOP support for mothers in need was characterized in our testing as offering women real options to choose life and embracing policies that would streamline adoption services, increase the child tax credit, make baby items tax-free, and provide funding to pregnancy care centers and maternity homes. Further, women should be informed about the financial help and adoption services available so she can make an educated choice, the SBA memo said.PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVES ARE DISAPPOINTED IN TRUMPS NEW ABORTION POLICY, BUT STICK BY HIM: ONLY ONE OPTIONSBA said it is committed to delivering its message to key presidential and congressional battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Montana.But without individual candidates joining the messaging, SBA indicated that Democrats would continue to see success in their spreading falsehoods and fearmongering in favor of abortion access.Most importantly, candidates themselves must draw this contrast and put money behind it. The ‘ostrich strategy’ from 2022 of candidates putting their heads in the sand cannot be repeated. This is urgent for GOP Senate candidates, who continue to trail across key races despite President Trump holding a consistent lead at the top of the ticket across those same states, SBAs memo states.Trump has ruffled feathers in the pro-life movement for his approach to abortion following the Dobbs decision. He criticized Floridas restriction on abortion in most cases after six weeks of pregnancy as cruel, but has indicated he would consider a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks.He has also said abortion restrictions should be a state issue, pushing back on calls for a nationwide protection of life bill, but in numerous rallies and speeches has criticized Democrats for wanting abortion to be legal up to and after birth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats and their abortion industry allies will not stop until America becomes a global abortion factory where women are forced into abortion and find few options when choosing life, SBA said. If this happens it will put the pro-life movement in an even worse position than it faced under the Roe regime. We must unite and stop them before it is too late.;Right

The two-day poll was conducted hours after a jury in Manhattan on Thursday found Trump guilty on all counts brought against him by District Attorney Alvin Bragg.The poll also found that a majority of Republican voters, 56%, said the outcome of the case would have no effect on their vote and 35% said they were even more likely to support Trump, who maintains his innocence.Even so, the potential loss of a tenth of Republican voters could decimate the presumptive GOP nominees chances to win back key battleground states President Biden claimed in his 2020 victory over Trump. That year, just 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin separated Biden and Trump from a tie in the Electoral College, according to NPR.TRUMP GUILTY VERDICT REVEALS SPLIT AMONG FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY OPPONENTSAmong independent registered voters, 25% said Trumps conviction made them less likely to support him in November, compared to 18% who said they were more likely and 56% who said the conviction would have no impact on their decision.The Reuters/Ipsos survey showed Biden and Trump nevertheless remain in a tight race, with 41% of voters saying they would vote for Biden if the election were held today and 39% saying they would pick Trump. The poll surveyed 2,556 U.S. adults nationwide with a 2 percentage point margin of error for registered voters.ROMNEY SCORCHES BRAGGS ‘POLITICAL DECISION’ IN TRUMP CASE: ‘MALPRACTICE’The presidential election is a little more than five months away. Many Republicans have said outrage over Trumps conviction has cemented support behind the former president. The Trump campaign posted impressive fundraising numbers a day after his conviction, totaling $53 million in the first 24 hours after the guilty verdict came down.Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. Survey respondents were divided on whether he should go to prison for his crimes, with 53% of registered voters saying he should not be jailed over the hush money case and 46% saying he should serve time.BILL MAHER STRUGGLES WHETHER TRUMP SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOLLOWING GUILTY VERDICT: ‘MAGA NATION WILL GO NUTS’Trumps conviction, and even imprisonment, would not prevent him from continuing to run for president. The Republican National Convention will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin four days after Trump is sentenced. The RNC adopted rules last year that did not include any specific provisions that address what happens if the presumptive nominee is convicted of a crime.Trump has repeatedly called his prosecution a witch hunt and insisted that Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan, who donated to an anti-Trump group, were politically motivated. Voters were split, with 52% saying the prosecution was mainly about upholding the rule of law and 46% saying it was about trying to prevent Trump from returning to the White House.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTrump has been indicted in three other criminal cases, but legal wrangling could keep those trials from occurring before the November election. Legal scholars consider the pending trials — which involve charges Trump engaged in electoral fraud and that he mishandled classified documents after leaving office — to be more serious than the hush money case. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.Most registered voters, 60%, said it was important for the three pending Trump trials to take place before the election, compared to 39% who said it was not important and 1% who did not answer the question.Reuters contributed to this report.;Right

229;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/us/third-strike-trans-rape-suspect-prompts-rebellion-against-ca-law-after-attack-womens-prison;3rd-strike trans rape suspect prompts rebellion against CA law after attack in womens prison;A transgender-identified California convict with a lengthy record of criminal violence has been transferred out of a womens correctional facility and back to a mens prison after being indicted for rape.Tremaine Tremayne Deon Carroll, 51, is an incarcerated biological male who identifies as a woman and faces two charges of forcible rape and one of dissuading a witness from testifying in Madera County, according to a criminal complaint first obtained by the website 4W, and later reported by Reduxx.One of the alleged victims of the Jan. 30 incident is a biological female, identified as Jane Doe in court documents, who said Carroll attacked her in the shower at the Central California Women’s Facility and raped her. The complaint also mentions another unidentified victim. Carroll has since been transferred to Kern Valley State Prison, a male-only facility in Delano, online records show.Womens rights activists tell Fox News Digital that Carroll, who was the public face of a campaign to support California law SB 132, which allows transgender prisoners to be housed in a facility consistent with their gender identity, is a case in point why the law harms incarcerated women.ALMOST 75% OF TRANSGENDER PRISONERS BEHIND BARS FOR RAPE, BRUTAL CRIMES IN THE UKPrevious to SB 132, biological male inmates were allowed to, on a case-by-case individualized basis, be placed in womens facilities. But not if they hadnt had surgery, and it was always very individualized. What the bill did, what SB 132 did is it took away all of that safeguarding, said Lauren Bone, legal director of the Womens Liberation Front (WoLF).WoLF is a self-described radical feminist organization that opposes policies that permit biological males in women-only spaces. The group currently represents four female inmates in a lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitations (CDCR) that seeks to have SB 132, which is called the Transgender Respect, Agency, and Dignity Act, declared unconstitutional.[SB 132] took away the ability to make individualized case assessments. It made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of anatomy and including things like hormones, Bone said. You dont have to identify as a woman anymore. You can identify as non-binary or many other things. And so, what the results are is that theres 50 men who are housed there. There are hundreds more on a wait list, who are still being processed. Nearly all of them have penises.Carroll is one of several female-identifying biological males represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, Transgender Law Center and Lambda Legal who intervened to oppose WoLFs lawsuit in August 2023. In sworn testimony, Carroll stated, I know what it feels like to live in fear and to carry the weight of the past abuse by men. But I am not a threat.Less than a year later, Carroll would be accused of rape.CALIFORNIA PROGRESSIVE CHIDES FELLOW DEMOCRATS BEFORE VOTING TO MAKE CHILD SOLICITATION A FELONY: ‘I’M DONEAttorneys for Carroll did not respond to a request for comment. The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, Lambda Legal and Transgender Law Center said in a joint statement that they are unable to speak about the specifics of Carrolls criminal case and all allegations of sexual misconduct must be investigated thoroughly and fairly.We continue to represent the intervenors – including four trans women and our partner organization TGIJP – to ensure that the voices of transgender people are heard in the case and the constitutionality of SB 132 is zealously defended, the statement says.Amie Ichikawa, founder and executive director of Women II Women and a former inmate who has closely followed Carrolls case, told Fox News Digital there is no history of Carroll identifying as any kind of LGBTQ+ person until SB 132 passed.This is somebody that I did keep a close eye on because of their history, their background, their habitual manipulation, frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit, constantly filing complaints against everyone. I knew this was going to be an issue, Ichikawa said.CALIFORNIAS PROPOSED PARENTAL NOTIFICATION POLICY FOR GENDER IDENTITY CHANGES FAILS TO QUALIFY FOR BALLOTCourt records show that Carrolls criminal history began in 1988, when he was 15. He was charged with grand theft of property and possession of a firearm by a minor. In 1990, he committed his first- and second-strike offenses under Californias three-strike law in a crime that involved allegations of kidnapping, robbery and sexual assault.Carroll was charged as an adult with three counts of kidnapping for ransom, two counts of robbery, and three counts of oral copulation in concert by force, according to records. However, some of the counts were dismissed on technicalities and the case ended with a hung jury and mistrial. Rather than be retried, Carroll pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnapping and was sentenced to prison for 10 years and eight months.Carrolls third strike came in 1998 when he was the getaway driver in a jewelry store robbery, leading to a 25-to-life sentence as a three-strike offender. While awaiting trial in 1999, sheriffs deputies, acting on a tip from a confidential informant, found him to be in possession of a metal wire shank. He was given an additional four years to be run consecutively with his 25-to-life term.In prison, Carroll committed various serious rule violations between 2001 and 2015. His offenses included fighting with other inmates, refusing to obey orders, drug possession, filing a false report against a peace officer and behavior that could lead to violence, according to court records. He also filed various complaints alleging racial discrimination and sexual misconduct by CDCR employees.Tremaine has a long history of filing lawsuits against the department, tons of lawsuits. He is constantly writing inmate complaints about everyone and anyone he can have a negative impact on, said Ichikawa.CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD BAN SCHOOLS FROM TELLING PARENTS IF STUDENT IDENTIFIES AS LGBTQ: ‘GUT-AND-AMEND’In several complaints reported by Reduxx, Carroll uses he/him pronouns to refer to himself and does not mention his gender identity or sexuality. It wasnt until 2021, three months after the Democrat-controlled California legislature passed SB 132, that he began to identify as a trans woman.SB 132, introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, requires that incarcerated transgender people in CDCR custody be classified and housed based on their sense of health and safety, which may or may not correspond with their gender identity.Transgender people in prison – particularly trans women – are at severe risk of assault and sexual victimization because they’re automatically housed by their birth-assigned sex, Wiener said in a statement after his bill passed. I’m authoring this legislation to ensure they can be housed where they’re safest. Transgender people should not be forced into isolation because they aren’t protected where they are forced to live.After SB 132 became law, Carroll was transferred to the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF) in 2021, located in Chowchilla. Carroll does not present as female and has not undergone sex reassignment procedures. He began to garner media attention at this time as one of the first transgender-identified inmates transferred out of a mens facility into CCWF.In a 2022 op-ed for the San Francisco Bay View, a national Black newspaper, Carroll again claimed to be the victim of discrimination and sexual misconduct by CDCR employees.Born with boy parts and a girl’s heart, and a confused mind was how life began. There were no dolls nor makeup nor dresses for an only child, Carroll wrote. The op-ed downplayed his prior criminal convictions, claiming he was given a 25-to-life sentence for non-violent, non-serious aiding Grand Theft. Carroll also claimed that from ages 5 to 14 he had been molested by his stepmother.BIOLOGICAL MEN ARE NOW WELCOME IN CALIFORNIA WOMENS PRISONS: ‘AN AGENDA FOR FEMALE ERASURE’The next year, Carroll was interviewed by MindSiteNews for an article that described him as an incarcerated transgender woman instrumental in several prison lawsuits. Carroll told the interviewer he never felt the need to outwardly identify as anything or wear lipstick or wear tight clothing or try to change my voice because doing so would put me in a box.So, simply because I identify as a woman, 99.9% of the people would assume I’m interested in men. I wasn’t looking for a boyfriend, ever. Not in life, not in men’s prison, not now, not never, Carroll said.The Madera County district attorney filed rape charges against Carroll earlier this year for an incident said to have occurred in January.On or about January 30, 2024, in the County of Madera, State of California, the crime of Forcible Rape … was committed in that TREMAINE D CARROLL did unlawfully have and accomplish an act of sexual intercourse with a person, to wit, Jane Doe, not against said persons will, by means of force, violence, duress, menace and fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on said person and another, the complaint states.Ichikawa told Fox News Digital the allegations are upsetting though unsurprising given how SB 132 has no guardrails to protect incarcerated women from male convicts with intact penises housed in their facilities.The committee thats reviewing these requests to transfer cant use someones criminal history, physical attributes, sexual orientation, anything like that. Anything that you would think would be a factor that should be taken into consideration before transferring someone to a womens prison is not allowed and deemed discriminatory, she said.PLANET FITNESS REVOKES WOMANS MEMBERSHIP AFTER SHE SNAPPED PHOTO OF TRANSGENDER WOMAN IN WOMENS LOCKER ROOMThere are 1,992 inmates in the custody of CDCR who identify as transgender. Of that number, 347 have attempted or are attempting to transfer into a womens facility and 44 so far have been successful, according to Ichikawa.People are under the impression that the law has allowed prisoners that resemble Laverne Cox to transfer when the reality is there is no other requirement outside of self ID, she said. When I was in CCWF for a special event last year, I was speechless. Actually being inside and seeing men walking around in what I once considered sacred grounds for broken women was shocking. The oppression and the silencing was so heavy. That place saved my life, but the prison I did my time in no longer exists.SB 132 was opposed by Republican lawmakers, joined by a handful of Democrats: We warned at the time that this would be abused,and that dangerous criminals would be placed with women in womens prisons, said state Rep. James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader in the California State Assembly.People in the normal world would say, No, you don’t house dangerous male criminals with women. And especially when youre talking about people who have a history of sexual violence. You never place them with women in a womens facility, Gallagher said. He contrasted this view with progressives in team crazy, which he said passed SB 132 for political correctness.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWoLF opposed SB 132 from the beginning and testified against the bill in legislative hearings. The groups lawsuit, filed in 2021, asserts that incarcerated women are being placed at a higher risk of sexual assault and pregnancy by SB 132 in violation of the Eighth Amendment. U.S. District Judge Jennifer Thurston dismissed the case on May 14, finding that CDCR, as a state agency, is immune from suit in federal court but gave WoLF leave to file an amended complaint by July 19.Bone said WoLF is working to fix the deficiencies in its original complaint and will re-file the lawsuit shortly. She said California policymakers need to care about everybody whos incarcerated, not just transgender prisoners.They have an obligation to the women who are incarcerated in state custody and in their state and to keep them safe, she said. They cant transfer risk of someone elses safety onto them and use them to shield males from other male violence. Women shouldnt have to be used for the validation of male identities.WoLF and Women II Women participated in a demonstration outside Carrolls scheduled hearing on May 17.

Its just tremendous.Back on Earth, the professionals at mission control were just a hair more concerned about Whites safety, the NASA website notes.Gemini 4, get back in, Virgil Gus Grissom reportedly yelled at White.Grissom, a fellow astronaut, was serving as CapCom during Gemini 4.White initially pushed back against the request to end the spacewalk, saying he was doing great and that the experience was fun before he gave in, NASA revealed.FIRST MEN ON THE MOON, A UNIQUE AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT, STILL AMAZES US TODAYI’m coming back in … and it’s the saddest moment of my life, said White when he finally agreed to reenter the capsule.In addition to the first U.S. EVA, Gemini 4 was another milestone mission in NASAs history. It was the first multi-day space flight by the United States, although it was shorter than a previous Soviet space flight.It also was the first U.S. spaceflight in which astronauts performed experiments.Whites EVA was considerably smoother than that of the first-ever EVA.On March 18, 10 weeks before Whites spacewalk, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk as part of the Voskhod 2 mission, according to the website for the European Space Agency.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, APRIL 17, 1970, APOLLO 13 ASTRONAUTS RETURN ALIVE, DEFY ODDS AFTER SPACE EXPLOSIONHe almost didnt make it back.Leonovs spacesuit expanded in space — so much so that he could not fit through the door back into the capsule after his 12 minutes outside the vehicle.Making a hair-raising decision, he opened a valve on the suit to let enough air escape for him to enter the airlock, said the European Space Agency.As for astronaut White, his time came to a sudden and tragic end less than two years after his historic spacewalk.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 20, 1927, CHARLES LINDBERGH DEPARTS FOR FIRST SOLO NONSTOP FLIGHT ACROSS ATLANTICWhite, along with fellow astronauts Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee, died on Jan. 27, 1967, when their cabin caught fire during a launch rehearsal test of the Apollo 1 mission.White was laid to rest at West Point Cemetery in New York with full military honors, said the National Air and Space Museums website.During his spacewalk, White experienced something other-worldly. He confided later to his friend, the Reverend Jackson Downey of First Methodist Church in Cocoa Beach, Florida, that out there alone in space, he’d sensed the presence of God, according to Christian website Crosswalk.com.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn 2015, on the 50th anniversary of his spacewalk, White was posthumously awarded NASAs Ambassador of Exploration Award.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERIn many ways, Ed’s spacewalk was the modern-day equivalent of Lewis and Clark’s portage across the Gates of the Mountains during exploration of the West. He had ventured into uncharted territory, said NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman in 2015 at the ceremony honoring White, according to the National Air and Space Museums site.That historical achievement is a big part of the reason why Mars is now within our sights, and we will continue to push EVA technological advancements as we move forward on our journey to Mars.;Right
233;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.outkick.com/sports/caitlin-clark-going-seriously-injured-racial-animus-continues-bobby-burack;Caitlin Clark Is Going To Be Seriously Injured If Racial Hostility Continues | Bobby Burack;At this rate, Caitlin Clark is going to be seriously injured on the basketball court.For months, the media has told us that Clark is the beneficiary of white and straight privilege. Sunny Hostin of The View also recently attributed Clarks popularity to tall and pretty privilege.Notable figures and outlets whove stoked the privilege flame include, but are not limited to, Jemele Hill, the other mean girls on The View, the New York Times, USA Today, Sheryl Swoopes, and Becky Hammon.We would all be very naive if we didn’t say race and her sexuality played a role in [Clarks] popularity, Hill bitterly recently told the LA Times.Already, society preaches to black Americans that white people are their enemies and their oppressors. According to a recent Gallup poll, most black people believe that.White derangement syndrome is real – particularly when involved in historically black spaces, like professional basketball.And thats the reality Caitlin Clark faces.Clark is the biggest star in womens basketball, where she competes against mostly black women who are told Clark is only more popular than them because of her skin color.The rabble-rousers programmed black players to dislike her. They succeeded.Aja Wilson and Angel Reese have jabbed Clark verbally on social media and in the media for weeks. And the animus toward Clark turned physical on Saturday when Clarks Indiana Fever faced the Chicago Sky.First, Chennedy Carter from the Sky appeared to call Clark a bitch and then slammed into her:Reese, a pampered brat, cheered and hugged Carter after shoving Clark:Later in the game, Reese elbowed Clark in the upper body and appeared to utter a slur at her when she hit the floor:No one, on either team, came to Clarks defense.After the game, Carter said she would not speak about Clark and then liked several posts on X telling her to shove Clark harder the next time:White privilege, huh? Attractive privilege, hey?We warned last month that Clark could be the subject of cheap shots and gratuitously physical play after noting an ominous trend in the NBA. While less pronounced, NBA players have shown similar hostility toward the surge of successful white players.‘Take Out’ White PlayersIn December, former NBA guard and thug Gilbert Arenas encouraged black players on his podcast to take out white players on the court because they were coming for our league.Since then, Pistons forward Isaiah Stewart punched Suns forward Drew Eubanks during a confrontation before the teams match-up in February, Draymond Green struck Jusuf Nurkic in the face, and stomped on the chest of Kings guard Domantas Sabonis during a game.Oddly, none of that should surprise anyone. History taught us long ago that when society inflames racial hatred, violence usually follows.In a normal society, the WNBA, media, players, and coaches would collectively condemn what happened to Clark on the court on Saturday. Unfortunately, they wont. Those groups are too afraid of the mob to ever dare stand up for the little white girl from Iowa – especially the media.Initially, ESPN completely ignored the Chennedy Carter-Caitlin Clark foul and fallout when providing postgame coverage of the Fever-Sky matchup. The network waited until late, when fewer viewers were watching, to mention the shove.Chiney Ogwumike and Elle Duncan (best known for bullying Sage Steele over her blackness) are the respective analyst and host of ESPNs main WNBA studio program, and youd think they were the praetorian guard of the black and brown women in the W.Ogwumike and Duncan spent last week threatening anyone who criticizes the women who hate on Clark with the word racist.Duncan responded to Charles Barkley and LeBron James defending Clark against petty WNBA players by asking, Who are these girls that are hating on Caitlin Clark? – as if she wasnt aware of the headlines.You’re just new in this space, and so while you’re new before you put your f***ing feet on my couch, look around, Duncan then told Bomani Jones. Get the lay of the land, get to know it a little bit before you just jump in and continue to fan flames of divisiveness that frankly target black and brown women. It’s not okay.Got that?The black and brown women denigrating and shoving Clark are not the problem. The people who notice are. (At least Duncan isnt advocating for teachers to talk about sex changes with third-graders anymore…)Ogwumike, who used to play in the WNBA, shared Duncans message, also claiming no one hates on Clark.Charles and Inside the NBA team are the GOATs of the industry, so respectfully I’ll offer my perspective with love, Ogwumike posted on X last week. Every WNBA player I know supports this rookie class and are grateful for the spotlight & money that Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and co. are bringing to the W!Ogwumike is smart. She watches the WNBA closely. She knows shes lying to her followers.OutKick asked both Duncan and Ogwumike about their defense of WNBA players following what happened to Clark on Saturday. We sent them the following email:Chiney and Elle,I am writing a story about how you two -- among a few others -- defended the WNBA players against the narrative that they hate on Caitlin Clark.Elle, you even said it was racist to claim they do.Well, today, as I am sure you both saw, Chennedy Carter shoved Clark for no reason, called her a bitch, and refused to comment after saying she would not speak about Clark.We also saw Reese cheer that a player slammed into Clark on a clearly dirty play.Do you both stand by your comments that there is no jealousy toward Clark? Do you two disagree that the jealousy is rooted in racial animus? Elle, do you still think its racist to say Reece has an issue with Clark?Neither woman responded. We will be sure to update this article if they do.We hope they do – not to make fun of them but for them to acknowledge publicly that they are part of the problem.How women of color in the WNBA feel about Clark is a symptom. A racialized culture is the cause.Not only is reducing Caitlin Clark down to her skin color and sexuality immoral, but its also willfully disingenuous.We recently researched the history of professional sports in America over the past 30 years to see if any trends or data points suggest white privilege contributes to popularity.In most cases, star players share three commonalities. Race is not one of them. Greatness, personality, and a riveting style of play are. Caitlin Clark checks off all three boxes.Perhaps thats why The View and Jemele Hill never cite any examples when attributing Clarks popularity to race. There arent any.A Media-Generated LieThe media cast Clark as the Great White Hope. Yet the narrative is not consistent with reality or the history of sports. Its a media-generated lie.We understand there are political points to score in propagating myths about Clarks popularity and success. However, young black women on the court appear to believe it and detest Clark for it.As a result, a once-in-a-generation phenomenon with the star power to mainstream womens basketball has to fear for her physical safety on the court.Whats happening to Clark underscores a much larger trend in America, in that the demand for racism in America vastly outstrips the supply.Unfortunately, bad-faith actors do not accept that. They feed off a racially divided nation.Of course, shoving and kicking people on the court is not akin to, well, burning cities and shooting people in the name of BLM. Still, someone will seriously injure Clark if the racial animus toward her continues.;Right

(See the video at the top of this article.)DISRUPTED SLEEP, PLUS NIGHTMARES COULD BE LINKED TO AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, EXPERTS SAYWright first experienced symptoms in 2012, he said, when he noticed tingling in his right foot while warming up for an overseas basketball game in Turkey.As I was shooting, I felt a tingling sensation in my right hand that eventually spread throughout my entire body within a matter of a minute, he told Fox News Digital.His coaches sent him to a doctor, who told him to take the day off.The next morning I woke up, and I couldnt walk. I couldnt stand up. I couldnt really use my limbs, he recalled.‘LIQUID GOLD’ COULD BRING NEW HOPE TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS, STUDY SUGGESTS: ‘PROFOUND BENEFIT’Wright returned to the doctor, this time in a wheelchair.They sent me to a specialist, where I was quickly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that can affect movement, vision, speech and other functions.After going through several other doctors, Wright found Dr. Crayton, a board-certified neurologist who practices at the Multiple Sclerosis Center of Greater Washington.What led me to her was her confidence and her ability to simplify what it meant to have MS and to make it manageable for me. [She] helped me understand that I could still go on with my career and my life in a way that I wanted to, he said.Crayton noted that the patient-doctor relationship is a marathon, not a sprint.She told Fox News Digital, Its really important to find a doctor they can trust, who they can communicate with, who they can partner with to make decisions.TEENAGER IS PRIMARY CAREGIVER FOR NEW MEXICO MOM WITH MS: WERE A TEAMYou need a team of people who support you, love you and accept you.Less than a year after his diagnosis, Wright became the first person with MS to play in the NBA when he signed with the Dallas Mavericks.MS impacted my career tremendously, because there was nobody before me, Wright told Fox News Digital.You need a team of people who support you, love you and accept you.I had NBA offers that were retracted because of the possibility of me having medical conditions and just being in uncharted territory — but I kept working and overcame it.BREAKTHROUGH FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SUFFERERS MAY INVOLVE HELPFUL HORMONE: ‘PATIENTS SHOULD REMAIN OPTIMISTIC’Wright, a husband and father of three, is no longer playing basketball these days, but he is feeling healthy and enjoying life, he said.Living with MS, it looks good, it feels good — I feel great, he said.I try to stay active. I try to stay healthy. I try to stay moving. And Ive been able to keep myself healthy and continue to be a father and live my life the way I want to live.‘Badge of honor’For all those facing a new diagnosis, Wright encouraged seeking out resources from people who have walked these halls before.There are people who understand what youre going through, and its important to hear other stories and get a foundational knowledge of what your life will look like moving forward.Wright is involved with Express4MS, a campaign that encourages people with MS to express themselves, share their stories and discuss treatment options with their doctors.Its just something you can put in your toolbox to find information, inspiration and motivation to live every day in a positive way, Wright said.Walk with pride, and know that youre going to be OK.I would say to people: Stay with it, go through those tough times, figure out what works for you, he said.Figure out how you can be successful at whatever it is you do.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERWright urges MS patients to look at the disease not as a hindrance, but as a badge of honor.He said, Walk with pride, and know that youre going to be OK.Clayton advises her MS patients to treat your body like a temple.It will pay you back in spades if you can invest in your health — eat well, exercise, sleep, she said.While people with MS will always have bad days, Wright is focused on maintaining a positive outlook.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs long as you’re above ground, you have an opportunity to make the most of it, he said.Every action has an equal and opposite reaction — so whatever you put out there is the energy thats going to come back.;Right

238;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/kitchen-disasters-fires-microwaves-what-do-things-go-wrong;Kitchen disasters including stovetop fires and smelly microwaves: What to do when things go wrong;Kitchen disasters of all types can happen to anyone.Maybe a meal thats being prepped on the stove suddenly goes up in flames.Maybe all the food cooked in the microwave tastes off somehow.FOOD FIGHT AT RESTAURANT RUNS DEEPER FOR FAMILY THAN JUST ONE NIGHT OUT: ‘THINK CAREFULLY’Or maybe oil from a container has leaked onto stone counter tops — leaving a stubborn and unsightly stain.What to do? How to handle these and other mishaps and misfortunes?Fox News Digital reached out to a variety of home, kitchen and cleaning experts and sources to seek tips and advice for common dilemmas.Heres smart advice to take in case these five scenarios occur in your home.1. Stovetop firesAnyone encountering an unexpected flame on a stovetop while cooking needs to exercise extreme caution during this scary situation — and be sure not to accidentally make a fire worse.Do not ever use water to put out a stovetop fire that originated with oil, Andy Bozzo, battalion chief of Contra Costa County Fire Protection District in Northern California, told Fox News Digital. Bozzo is also co-founder of Tablet Command, an incident management software company.Stay calm, slide a lid over the fire and turn off the heat.Water can exacerbate the fire and spread it quickly out of the container into larger areas of the kitchen, Bozzo said via email.To fight the fire, Bozzo advised people to stay calm, slide a lid over the fire and turn off the heat. Flour, sugar, or baking powder should not be used to smother the fire.Covering the fire removes the source of oxygen, he said, while turning off the stove will remove the heat source.When you feel comfortable and the pot or pan has cooled, take the lid and pot outside, he said.If a fire goes beyond the pot, Bozzo recommends using a dry chemical extinguisher that is specifically labeled for use for kitchen fires. Aim the contents of the extinguisher at the base of the fire, he said.COTTAGE CHEESE BAKING HACK BLOWS UP ON TIKTOKBut if a fire spreads into cabinets or past the oven, it is probably too big to fight on your own, he said.Get everyone out of the house and call 9-1-1 immediately from outside the home, he said.2. Smelly microwavesOther mishaps can occur in the kitchen that dont rise to the level of fire — but are still pesky and problematic.To get rid of stubborn smells in the microwave, use a lemon, San Diego-based Chantelle Hartman Malarkey, known as the Lifestyle Alchemist, told Fox News Digital via email.Place a small bowl of water with a half cut-up lemon in it and microwave it for one minute, she said.In addition to cleaning the microwave, the lemon scent removes any lingering odors, she said. This is an easy solution and a game-changer, she said.Sliced lemons can also be used to deal with fridge odors, Malarkey added — and a sliced lime topped with salt can be used to brighten dull metal fixtures.FARMERS MARKET FOOD-SHOPPING SECRETS IN 5 KEY CATEGORIES: ‘GET THE BEST QUALITY’Lemon juice can also be used in a pitch as a DIY stain remover, Malarkey told Fox News Digital, if food or drinks were to spill on fabrics.Add some lemon juice, baking soda, white vinegar, a little dish soap and some water to a bowl and apply to the stain, she said.3. Countertop stainsDiscovering a stain on a marble or quartz countertop can be a distressing experience, U.K.-based home remodeler Matthew O’Grady told Fox News Digital.Marble is porous and can be etched by acidic materials, he said. OGrady is director of Thomas Matthew Kitchens & Furniture.To help lift stains, make a paste with baking soda and water, he said. This paste should be applied to the stain, covered in plastic wrap, and sit for at least 24 hours before being wiped away.Quartz countertops, while generally more resilient than their marble counterparts, are also subject to stains.Stay away from harsh chemicals, as these can harm the surface.A solution of warm water mixed with mild dish soap or a non-abrasive cleaner should work well, said OGrady.AS ‘MANIC CLEANING’ TRENDS ON TIKTOK, PSYCHOLOGISTS REVEAL REASONS, RISKS BEHIND IMPULSIVE TIDYINGHe said people should stay away from harsh chemicals, as these can harm the surface.Instead, brush away with an extra toothbrush laying around — works like magic!4. Scratches and dings on cabinetsThere are easy solutions for fixing scratches, stains, and dings in wooden furniture and cabinets, said OGrady.Water rings on wooden surfaces can be buffed out with toothpaste, he said, before applying wood polish to bring back the luster.Minor scratches on wooden surfaces can sometimes be remedied by an oil-and-vinegar paste or a small amount of mineral oil, he said.Using a gentle cloth, apply the mixture to the scratch, allow it to sit for a few minutes, then buff it out, said OGrady.Deeper scratches, on the other hand, may require the use of a wood filler that complements your surface — which should be followed by careful sanding and refinishing.5. Rusted cast-iron pansWhile soap should not be used to clean cast iron, all is not lost if the pan takes a trip through the dishwasher.8 KITCHEN GADGETS TO TAKE YOUR COOKING TO THE NEXT LEVELStill, exposing a cast iron pan to excessive moisture can cause rusting, said the website for Loge Cast Iron.The first step to restoring a cast iron is to scour it, said Loge.This can be done with warm, soapy water, plus a metal scouring pad.Its OK to use the scouring pad and soap since you are preparing to re-season the cookware, said Loge. Rinse and hand-dry thoroughly.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERAfter the cookware has dried, rub a very thin layer of cooking oil on the inside and outside of the item, said Loge.The oiled cast iron should be put upside-down in a hot oven for an hour.This oil coating will help to create a barrier that will season the cast iron.Next, the oiled cast iron should be put upside-down in a hot oven for an hour.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPlace the cookware in the oven upside down on the top rack and place aluminum foil on the bottom rack to catch any excess oil that may drip off the cookware, said Loge.This process can be repeated as necessary — with the cookware cooling in between bakes.For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.;Right

If we really want to be honest, the world isnt talking about the WNBA, its talking about Caitlin Clark who just happens to play in the league.READ: Caitlin Clark Shatters WNBA Ratings Records, Proves To Be Leagues Biggest StarPlenty of folks at ESPN understand this, the offices in Bristol arent entirely filled with people who lack common sense, but Pat McAfee seems to be the only one at the four-letter network willing to discuss the very obvious situation.During Mondays edition of his show, McAfee reacted to Chennedy Carter of the Chicago Sky putting Clark on the floor with a cheapshot over the weekend. The hard foul added more fuel to the ridiculous conversation about Clark needing to ‘earn her stripes’ as a rookie and how its fine for non-rookies in the league to feel frustrated that shes already looked at as the face of the WNBA less than a half-season into her professional career.McAfee isnt having it. He and his co-hosts played a game of ‘Which WNBA Rookie’ to perfectly rip apart the theory that Clark isnt the driving force behind the interest in the league. Nothing McAfee said was opinion, either, he brought facts to the discussion.He closed out the segment by calling out those in the media pushing the narrative that the entire 2024 rookie class is driving the conversation in the league, when in reality it all falls on the shoulders of Clark.I would like the media people that continue to say ‘this rookie class, this rookie class, this rookie class, no, lets just call it for what it is. Theres one white bit-h for the Indiana team who is a superstar, McAfee said.We have to hear people say that ‘we all like her because she’s white or ‘she’s only popular because the rest of the rookie class is doing well, well thats a bunch of bullsh-t, he continued.This entire narrative were seeing play out with Clark that is not-so-subtly focused on the color of her skin was incredibly predictable, but seeing it already hit this level just 11 games into her career is a bit surprising.;Right

I hope you’re happy, Anthony Edwards, now Cam’ron is pissed. The Purple Haze rapper freestyles over Black Rob’s iconic Whoa beat to begin his It Is What It Is Podcast. He is joined by fellow Harlem rapper Ma$e Monday morning, and its available on YouTube. Cam’ron takes issue with the new Adidas commercial promoting Edwards’ first signature, the AE 1.In the ad, a friend chilling on a bench reads the receipts … of all the hate to Edwards while he is shooting jumpers. Edwards’ friend only specifically names Cam’ron and former NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony. Ant-Man responds with F***, buddy to Cam’ron’s opinion presumably given on his podcast, To me, he’s an All-Star but not a superstar, yet.Now, it probably isn’t the best time to be a Grammar Nazi, but the comma behind F*** is doing a little work here. Edwards could perhaps argue the comma makes this a two-part statement. First, Ant-Man is angry that Cam’ron criticizes him and, second, Edwards calls him a buddy. However, the buddy can be taken condescendingly. Well, Cam’ron didn’t read it that way.Donning mad jewelry, including his trademark Diplomat iced-out piece, a Luka Dončić Dallas Mavericks jersey, and, eventually, a bucket hat, Cam’ron rips Edwards. The first two-plus minutes of the freestyle is Camron warming up with bars about his legacy, reputation, recent beef with Melyssa Ford, etc. before addressing the Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star with But, f*** wrong with Ant-Man?He continues with Gave him his props. Homie got love for me. New commercial, yall aint got love for me? He shot a jump and said ‘F***, buddy’. The receipt reader looking like ‘You’re f***ed buddy. And, trust buddy, I dont want to judge, buddy. Buddy sitting there glazing at you like ‘I love buddy’. Granted, Camrons Ant-Man squashing isnt as bad as Kendrick drawing and quartering Drake in their recent beef, but its scathing.Camron keeps it real with Anthony Edwards about AdidasAfter calling Edwards the B-ball version of Kanye, the Diplomat frontman rhymes Stop it, dude. Yall just stopping through. He [Edwards] do something yall dont like, youll drop him too. Camron ends by reminding Edwards about the famous injuries of Adidas-sponsored dudes. F***ing careers up: T-Mac, Derrick Rose, RGIII, John Wall, let ‘em know … You know Kevin Ware? Google what was on his toes. Whoa.This part of Camrons diss track hit me the hardest. One of the unwritten laws of hooping is that you Dont wear Adidas. Adidas has taken some big swings and misses with its basketball products while never really eating into Nikes market share. Honestly, if you have anything on your feet besides Nike basketball sneakers, you run the risk of destroying your legs.Look at the athletes whose careers were cut short and coincidentally wearing Adidas. Ware had one of the most gruesome injuries in basketball history, suffering a compound fracture of his leg during the 2013 Elite Eight. Tracy McGrady battled through knee and ankle injuries for years. Fellow OutKick hoops handicapper, David Troy, and I joked about what Adidas did to D-Roses career.This Camron-Anthony Edwards beef is currently the most interesting thing in the NBA, which is alarming considering the Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics 2024 NBA Finals start this week. But, thats how the NBA has been operating for years. Off-the-court drama and the player empowerment era get more attention than any game. Given the lack of American star power, that trend will continue for the 2024 NBA Finals. Hopefully, Camron drops a diss track on NBA commissioner Adam Silver._____________________________Follow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.;Right

Because McDavid is about the only draw that the Edmonton Oilers vs. the Florida Panthers Final has for hockey fans in the United States.Sure, there are some Florida Panthers fans who started watching hockey when Florida got good a few years ago. Before I get emails from those tens of fans, just understand that the television ratings dont lie. Florida Panthers playoff games do not do well in the ratings, at least they dont unless theyre facing the New York Rangers (or the Boston Bruins, for that matter).See, the NHL really wanted the Rangers in the Stanley Cup Final. Its no secret that New York draws better than every other team in the league when it comes to television. There are other teams that draw well, too, but Florida isnt one of them. Plus, they have only one American player on their playoff roster (to be fair, though, its their best player, Matthew Tkachuk).That brings us to Edmonton. There are not a lot of Oilers fans in the United States. Canadian viewers dont count towards the television ratings that the league needs to sell its product to American networks. Thus, the NHL has a disaster on its hands in the form of two teams that people just arent going to be interested in watching.Unless, of course, the league can convince casual hockey fans to watch Connor McDavid, easily the best hockey player of this generation (possibly ever, based on talent). Its McDavids first trip to the Stanley Cup Final in his nine seasons in the NHL. This was just the second time his Oilers even reached the Western Conference Final.Major League Baseball is often criticized for not marketing its biggest stars and best players properly. The NHL has a golden opportunity to put McDavid front-and-center, and use Tkachuk as an American rival to the Canadian superstar.Can they pull it off and get the United States audience to watch? Thats what were going to find out.The Stanley Cup Final matchup between the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers is a problem for the NHL, but so is the schedule.The NHL had a great opportunity to capitalize on the NBA having a huge gap between its conference finals and the NBA Finals.The Dallas Mavericks eliminated the Minnesota Timberwolves last Thursday. The NBA Finals dont start until this Thursday. The NHL had a chance to keep its momentum going and start the Stanley Cup Final before the NBA got going and generate some buzz.But they arent doing that. Instead, the NHL is taking nearly a week off just like the NBA. Except, the NHL had two six-game conference finals, where the NBA had a sweep and a five-game series. The Stanley Cup Final doesnt begin until Saturday.Not only that, but with the days off in-between, Game 7 of the NHLs final series wouldnt happen until June 24! The latest possible date for the NBA Finals to end is June 23. Theres an argument to be made that both seasons are far too long, but thats for another day.Plus, because the NBA got its schedule out first, the NHL had to work around it. Instead of getting the best spots during the week, the NHL is starting its final series on a Saturday night in June. Its pretty fair to wonder if people have better things to do on a summer Saturday night than watch the Stanley Cup Final.They also have Game 4 scheduled for a Saturday night and Game 6 scheduled for a Friday night. Add it all up and the NHL figures to have a lower-rated Stanley Cup Final than its Eastern Conference Final. Is that me being biased as a bitter New York Rangers fan? Somewhat.But the point holds. People care about the New York Rangers and love them or hate them, they tune in to watch. Good luck getting Americans to watch the Edmonton Oilers and the Florida Panthers.;Right

Smith Admits Black WNBA Women Are Jealous Of Caitlin Clark Because Of Her Race;Stephen A. Smith admitted to what only OutKick has written for the past four months: women in the WNBA are jealous of Caitlin Clark and race is a contributing factor.There are girls – young ladies – in the WNBA who are jealous of Caitlin Clark. She is a White girl that has come into the league, Smith said while discussing Chennedy Carter shoving Clark to the floor on Saturday.She has bursted onto the scene. She hasn’t proven herself yet. It’s not even about them thinking they’re better than her because they probably know it at this particular juncture because they’ve been playing on a level she just arrived to.One would think that folks would be smart enough to recognize and appreciate that about Caitlin Clark – piggyback off of that to their benefit and praise her and support her for it while competing on the court against her.Hes right – about all of that.We hope he doesnt backtrack. Smith is known to make a good point, upset Black Twitter, and then cave.Last month, he apologized to the black community for citing polls that suggest black Americans relate to Donald Trumps feeling that the system is persecuting him.Carter could have separated Clarks shoulder. Angel Reese cheered the cheap shot. Carter doubled down on X, liking tweets encouraging her to injure Clark further. WNBA influencers like Kelsey Nelson and Monica McNutt defended Carter for the incident.The WNBA did not suspend or even fine Carter.The precedent is set.At this rate, Caitlin Clark is going to be seriously injured on the basketball court.We explained on Sunday:How women of color in the WNBA feel about Clark is a symptom. A racialized culture is the cause.History taught us long ago that when society inflames racial hatred, violence usually follows.Already, society preaches to black Americans that white people are their enemies and their oppressors. According to a recent Gallup poll, most black people believe that.White derangement syndrome is real – particularly when involved in historically black spaces, like professional basketball. And thats the reality Caitlin Clark faces.What we’re going to do is give the level of appreciation that it deserves in terms of the venom and potential hostility that exists toward this ‘golden girl’ who happens to be white and how the WNBA is promoting her, Smith concludes.Ultimately, very few people in the media have the stability and courage to defend Clark against her jealous, gratuitously aggressive black counterparts – understanding the race mob is looming.Stephen A. Smith is the most influential voice in the sports media. He has the platform to shine a bright light on the hatred stemming from Clarks arrival in the WNBA.;Right
246;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/media/brentwood-blight-supreme-court-case-allowed-governments-seize-property-behalf-developers;Brentwood blight: How a Supreme Court case allowed governments to seize property on behalf of developers;As fireworks burst in the sky on Independence Day 2018, Roxanne and Carter Maier were putting in yet another grueling 14-hour day of remodeling a former doctors office into a dance studio in Brentwood, a small suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.This is the last time were doing this, the husband and wife team told each other multiple times throughout the move to their new location. Sweat poured down their faces as they ripped industrial carpet away from the concrete floor. They invested about $100,000 and countless hours renovating the building with the hopes of eventually purchasing it.But just a few years later, the city declared a strip of businesses — including the Maiers — and small industrial buildings blighted. It moved to hand over the land to a private developer in a $436 million deal that seeks to use eminent domain to force out existing property owners and replace them with apartments, a hotel, office space, a microbrewery and stores.The developer behind the project estimated it would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years.SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF TEXAS GRANDMOTHER THROWN IN JAIL AFTER CRITICIZING CITY GOVERNMENTThe Maiers, now in their 50s and 60s, are faced with the prospect of yet another move.At this point in our life, Carter said, do we want to go through again what we did last time?Several business and property owners affected by the deal are suing, accusing the City of Brentwood of using a vague blight designation as a pretext to give their property to a private company. It’s a strategy local governments across the nation are using to skirt state eminent domain restrictions, according to their lawyers.Kelo v. New London: The SCOTUS case that changed everythingA 2005 Supreme Court ruling allowed cities like Brentwood to seize property in the name of economic development.The catalyst for the case happened around the turn of the millennium in Connecticut. After pharmaceutical giant Pfizer built a plant in New London in 1998 — with the added bonus of an 80% tax abatement — the city wanted to revitalize the surrounding area. Officials approved a development plan that required seizing homes and selling the property to developers to build new commercial and residential complexes. The city also agreed to kick in $78 million for the project.Susette Kelo and other property owners sued and were represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit civil liberties law firm now representing the Brentwood businesses. They argued New London was violating the Fifth Amendments takings clause, which prohibits the government from confiscating private property without just compensation. The property owners argued seizing their homes to sell to private companies was not a public use.But in a 5-4 opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the seizure qualified as public use because the city was following an economic development plan, not just trying to benefit a certain group of private citizens.The specter of condemnation hangs over all property, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in her dissent. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY AFTER SUPREME COURT RULES TEXAS RANCHER CAN SUE STATE OVER FLOODED LANDSWithin a year of the decision, local governments condemned or threatened eminent domain against nearly 6,000 homes, churches, businesses and other private properties, according to Institute for Justice researchers.The Supreme Court ruling also triggered a nationwide backlash, and soon, 43 state legislatures and eight state supreme courts strengthened protections for property owners, including Missouri, where lawmakers passed a bill in 2006 specifying that property cant be seized solely for economic development.But Missouri and other states included a carve-out that would prove critical. Cities could still move to seize blighted areas, defined by Missouri law as having insanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site improvements or other factors that present economic or social liability.That broad definition can be used to condemn entire neighborhoods, even if individual homes or other properties are in spectacular condition, according to the state.Institute for Justice attorney Bob Belden, who represents the businesses in their lawsuit, said cities across the country are taking advantage of extremely elastic definitions of blight.If you know anything about deterioration, by definition, the moment something is built, it starts to deteriorate, Belden said. So one problem that we see cities exploiting is a sort of lack of concrete detail on what the blight factors are.Brentwood officials declare area blighted, immediately threaten eminent domainDeer Creek meanders through the area behind the Maiers dance studio and chiropractor office. It used to flood during heavy storms, damaging businesses on Manchester Road. So Roxanne Maier said she wasnt all that surprised when, in 2018, the city deemed the area blighted.There were several properties in that time that were blighted, she said. They were not really in the best condition, but they had flooded every once in a while, and people werent going to be putting a lot of money into a building that would flood again.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREThen in 2019, the city launched a $95 million flood mitigation project, converting around 14 areas around the troublesome creek into green space. Officials at the time hoped that getting the area out of the flood plain would kickstart future development.Its beautiful, Roxanne said of the improvements. Carter said people are already walking and jogging on new trails by the creek, and that in addition to the flood mitigation, the city installed fresh sidewalks, street lighting and repaved a large stretch of the formerly deteriorating Manchester Road.So the Maiers and other business owners were shocked when the city again deemed the area blighted and announced a plan to have Green Street, a major St. Louis development firm, replace the small storefronts with a new, mixed-use development. Property owners could either sell willingly or be forced out by eminent domain under the plan.I have to sell my property, and lucky you, you get a property that’s out of a floodplain, and the roads are done and beautiful sidewalks, one property owner said during an Aug. 15, 2022, public meeting, gesturing at representatives of Green Street sitting behind her.The citys original blight designation eventually expired, according to business owners.Then in 2023, despite investing heavily in improvements, Brentwood officials again declared 77 acres of Manchester Road blighted, a slightly smaller section than the original 2018 boundaries.When they re-blighted it after they had done all these improvements, it made no sense, said Carolyn Wilson, who started a meal-prep business with her sister in 2004. But it also made us feel extremely vulnerable and powerless.A blight study the city published in 2023 listed few specific problem properties, but noted that about 60% of buildings were 52 years old or older, meaning they likely contain hazardous materials and unsafe conditions.Photos taken between 2022 and 2023 and included in a city presentation showed wooden pallets propped up near a trash can, seemingly-unoccupied buildings, loose bricks in a wall and parking lots with cracked or crumbling pavement. The city noted that newer buildings in the area needed fresh paint or other repairs.GRANDMOTHER WINS $4 MILLION AFTER SWAT RAIDED WRONG HOME BASED ON FIND MY IPHONE APPThe study also found that the private properties in poor condition will generate less tax revenues than similarly situated properties in better condition. Therefore, the area constitutes an economic liability, the city wrote in its presentation.Its bogus, said Bob Story, who runs Feather-Craft, a fly-fishing business his father founded in 1955 and has been located on Manchester Road since 1989. This area looks exactly like every other area around here in Brentwood.Story added, Its all about the tax revenue.The city declined an interview request and would not comment on the development plans or the lawsuit.Under the law, eminent domain is legal to address a blighted area, Brentwood Mayor David Dimmit said during a July 2023 public meeting. That has always been part of the process.He argued having a master redeveloper like Green Street take over the entire area would create a cohesive, thriving area, which wouldnt be possible by simply purchasing a few properties here and there.Later that month, the Board of Aldermen approved an ordinance to redevelop around 40 acres of the area. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2025, and Green Street would need to acquire all the properties within the redevelopment boundaries, local media reported.IJs lawsuit alleges businesses in the area were never informed that their properties were considered blighted and that city officials never told the plaintiffs their properties could be seized. The suit further argues the city failed to present substantial evidence of deterioration or unsafe conditions and merely used the blight designation as a pretext to seize private property on Green Streets behalf.Representatives for Green Street did not return multiple emails and phone calls seeking comment on the project. In proposals for the development, the company estimated the project would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years, including nearly $42 million in taxes for local jurisdictions and $51.6 million for the Brentwood School District.But the company is also facing internal issues.Green Street owes the city of St. Louis nearly $800,000 in delinquent property taxes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in December. Contractors filed dozens of lawsuits against the company, many of which have since been resolved, claiming they hadnt been paid for their work. And last year, the company laid off a half dozen employees, blaming current levels of economic activity, the Post-Dispatch reported.Green Streets lobbyist did not answer questions about the property taxes or other problems, local outlets reported.The road ahead for business ownersThe case raises the question of whether anybody in the United States really owns their property if all it takes for the government to take it away from you is that the government can come by and think, ‘Well, I could probably use this property better,’ Belden, the Institute for Justice attorney, told Fox News Digital.And while property owners will be paid if their buildings are seized, renters like the Maiers, Story and Wilson arent entitled to much other than whats in their lease agreements and possible relocation assistance, Belden said. Wilson and her sister fear moving would make it difficult for their business to survive.Weve been in our present location for 20 years, and were well known in the area and everybody knows where we are, she said. Theyre used to coming to our current location.Belden sees echoes of the Kelo case, which he called one of the Supreme Courts most widely reviled decisions, in the Brentwood fight, as well as a cautionary tale.Crews tore down dozens of houses and bulldozed the New London neighborhood, but nearly two decades after the Supreme Court victory authorizing it, most of the land remains a barren lot.Pfizer shuttered its plant just before its tax breaks expired, scrapping 1,400 jobs and moving its operations a few miles away to another campus to cut costs. Earlier this year, crews laid the foundation for a future community center on a small portion of the land. Other parcels have recently been sold to companies hoping to build apartments and a hotel.To this day, the property where [Kelos] home used to sit is vacant, Belden said. The only thing that has occupied the property there at any point has been feral animals.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHe sees Green Streets tax debts and other problems as a harbinger of whats to come.You make on the front end all of these promises about what will come, he said.

They didnt want this kind of hollow, empty gesture concept of law and order that I think a lot of us have lived with for four years.Nathan Vasquez, a longtime prosecutor, beat his boss, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt, in Tuesdays nonpartisan primary election after running a tough-on-crime-campaign. Vasquez received endorsements from several police groups, crime victims and business owners.THIS RED STATE IS BECOMING AN ‘EXPAT’ COMMUNITY FOR FAMILIES FLEEING WESTERN LIBERAL BASTIONS[Vasquez] can begin serving victims rather than criminals, street photographer and homeschooling mom Tara Faul told Fox News Digital. Schmidts MO seemed to be just letting these people back out and letting them re-offend, and it became pretty hopeless.Schmidt, whose campaign received contributions from groups linked to liberal billionaire George Soros, took office during the height of Portland’s 2020 protests. He soon announced a policy of declining to prosecute the most common riot-related charges.But complaints of a revolving door at the jail extend beyond protesters. Officers with the Portland Police Bureau told Fox News earlier this year theyve arrested alleged drug dealers, thieves and repeat offenders, only to have them appear back on the streets within hours.Thats unfortunately the reality where we work and thats not up to us, officer David Baer said in January.The DAs office filed charges in just 47% of all cases it received in 2020. That rate has been steadily increasing since then, hitting 60% in 2022. But during the same time frame, police began sending fewer cases to Schmidt, according to data provided to Fox News last spring by the district attorney’s office.Faul and others in Portland say such policies exacerbated crime and created a feeling of lawlessness in the City of Roses.CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: THE HOMESCHOOLING MOM DOCUMENTING PORTLANDS DESTRUCTIONIt has been a war zone of drug dealing and petty crime for the past at least four years, said Charles Froelick, who has owned an art gallery near downtown Portland since 1995.Froelick remembers when the city was a destination for people around the globe. But between Oregons strict pandemic response in 2020 and the subsequent riots, he said walk-in traffic just plummeted.Clients are saying they dont want to come downtown anymore, he said. People with children saying they dont want their children to see the activity on the streets, on the sidewalks.Just this week, Faul said a man stole her childs guitar off the front porch of her home. The alleged crime happened in broad daylight, while her family was home, and was captured on their Ring camera. She hasnt filed a police report, and doesnt know if its worth the effort.It just seems like an incredible waste of time, and I think a lot of people who have things stolen from them feel the same way, she said.

He testified in favor of removing mandatory minimum sentences for felony crimes other than murder, introduced a court focused on rehabilitation and behavioral health support for individuals charged with some felonies, and championed the decriminalization of drugs in Oregon.He reversed course on the latter this year, endorsing lawmakers proposal to recriminalize hard drugs following a sharp backlash from Oregonians.Vasquez said in a statement that he is committed to ending open-air drug dealing and drug use while helping connect individuals to treatment, to rebuilding the broken relationships between the DA’s office and the community, and to ensuring that victims are the number one priority of my office.Violent crimes like homicides and shootings have waned since hitting record highs in 2022, according to PPB data, but Portlanders Fox News Digital spoke with see much room for improvement.I still think its going to take years, even with [Vasquez] winning this race, to rebuild, not only the trust, but just the actual safety downtown, said Chandler, who talks to numerous residents and public figures on his podcast NW Fresh.CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS BEYOND A TURNING POINT AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?The replacement of a progressive stalwart with a challenger who was a Republican until registering as an Independent in 2017 marks a radical change for the reliably-liberal Portland area.

Read parts one, two, three and four.COEUR DALENE, Idaho — Seth Horst used to avoid telling strangers what he did for a living. Police officer felt like a four-letter word in 2020, especially in California.Fast-forward a year and Horst stood with his family in downtown Coeur dAlene, Idaho, watching fire trucks and police cars roll through the street for the citys Independence Day celebration. The Kootenai County sheriff waved at residents from the back of a pickup truck, a revolver snug against his hip, Horst recalled. Cars, homes and businesses around town display the blue line flag year-round, and Horst said its not unusual for people to offer to buy coffee for police when they see them out in the streets.That is so powerful for the men and women in uniform up here to have that backing, said Horst, who left California Highway Patrol and started a real estate business in North Idaho. Its a pretty phenomenal place to do the job.BLUE CITYS EXODUS CONTINUES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR, BUT SLOWER: PEOPLE JUST FEEL TRAPPEDThe Gem State has become a popular moving destination for both retired and active-duty police officers, a trend Horst and Idaho Fraternal Order of Police President Bryan Lovell broadly attribute to a more positive climate.They come to Idaho where they can enjoy their career and make a difference, Lovell told Fox News Digital. They see that, in large part, our communities are supportive of law enforcement and public safety.Cities large and small across the country suffered severe staffing shortages on the heels of anti-police protests in 2020. Four years later, some departments still can’t stop the bleeding.Seattle’s police staffing is at its lowest level since the 1990s, according to a March KING 5 report. Earlier this year in California, the Alameda Police Department offered a $75,000 signing bonus — the highest in the nation — on top of a six-figure starting salary to try to entice new officers.And while Lovell said Idaho hasnt been immune to recruiting challenges, the state also saw a wave of out-of-state police applications around the same time other departments began losing officers.CRISIS IN NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS BEYOND A TURNING POINT AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO FENTANYL: CITY OVERRUN WITH DRUGS SEES PROGRESS AFTER OVERWHELMED POLICE GET NEW HELPThe number of officers from other states who applied for certification in Idaho more than doubled from 2019 to 2021, according to data from the Idaho Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST). While the annual applications have dwindled since then, they remain above pre-2020 levels.Lovell said officers from other states have called him, looking for employment. Many were frustrated with local policies that defunded police departments or decriminalized drugs, he said.The district attorney doesnt back them, theres too much liability, so the department wont let them enforce the law, which is their job, Horst said. And that bugs a lot of people.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREThey get a job up here, oftentimes taking a huge pay cut because the pay here does not compare to a lot of states, he added. But its worth it to them to raise their families in a place that is safe and has those old-school values.An officer joining the Coeur d’Alene Police Department could expect to make between $63,000 and $89,000 per year before overtime, according to a recent job posting. The range is larger for the Idaho State Patrol, starting at about $48,000 per year but going up to nearly $103,000.But the biggest blue boost in Idaho comes from retirees, Lovell and Horst said.Retired police officers from Los Angeles, San Diego and other Golden State cities gather regularly for coffee, said Horst, who keeps up with several retiree groups. Around 40 former Seattle officers also live in the area, he added. It makes sense — California, Washington and Oregon are the three states fueling Idahos rapid population growth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Los Angeles Times reported last December that California public employees were leaving the state in droves and taking their pensions with them. The Boise suburb of Eagle received more CalPERS money in 2022 than any other ZIP code outside of California, according to the Times analysis.Im sure the state of California funds a lot of the stuff in North Idaho, Horst said.But the high concentration of former first responders offers something less tangible than money. It gives people like Horst, who moved to the area without already having strong social circles, a home away from home.To have that immediate bond where they can go and just feel safe, talk with somebody, share stories, that kind of resource is huge, he said.

I think everyone needs it. If we just focus on the dark things, were going to go to a dark place. So its cool to have it, and I think its definitely making a comeback, Josh Ocean Thomas told Fox News Digital.During a show earlier this month, Thomas, who does a lot of crowd work in his sets, asked an audience member named Nick what he does for a living.

You could have said youre a hooker and I would have been prouder of you.Are you ready to be unemployed or whats your vibe, Thomas asked after further joking with the staffer about his job within the administration.Thomas told Fox News Digital he met the staffer after the show, and he was a good sport about the joke.The second the guy told me he worked for the Biden administration, it was over for him. I felt bad already because my brain went into comedic autopilot. Its funny, and thats all Im trying to do. Im not trying to make any points... its funny.

We just need to do more of that.JON STEWART SAYS BIDEN ‘SHOULDN’T BE PRESIDENT DURING COMEDY SET: ‘WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THIS?’Thomas emphasized he is not a political comedian, rather, he pulls from real-world experiences and his own story to craft his jokes.I joke about life. All of my jokes are about my life or life experience. Some of them are made up life experiences, but theres stuff that like I would do. And like thing that like I would say. My standup is about me.

Now, he hosts regular shows at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Chicago.From the beginning of his career to now, Thomas has observed an industry comeback as comedy clubs reopen and more people yearn for a laugh.I started comedy, there wasnt a comedy club open, which was the worst time because obviously they couldnt be open if they wanted to. There was a virus going around... but its when we needed them the most, he said.Comedian Karith Foster added on Fox & Friends last week that, despite cancel culture giving comedy a run for its money, most people can go anywhere and say anything right now.I feel like comedys making a comeback, finally, because it is so apparent, people are so disappointed, Foster told co-host Brian Kilmeade. And the fact that we are living like Groundhog Day over and over again, the same people, same choices for a major election. People are done, theyre tired.Both Foster and Thomas emphasized that despite what cancel culture tries to imply, comedians dont make jokes with malicious intent or hate.If anyone sees a standup comedian go on stage...and if they said something that might hurt someones feelings, if they think that comedian got out of bed that morning and said, Im going to go on stage tonight and Im going to hurt peoples feelings and Im going to go to hurt people, that is crazy, Thomas said.

Here are 5 reasons even he should learn to love the Trump tax cuts;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!No issue defines the diametrically opposite economic philosophies of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump than their position on the Trump tax cuts. Trump wants to make those tax cuts permanent, Biden has repeatedly promised to tax America back to prosperity by repealing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But there are so many factual errors swirling around regarding the Trump tax cuts that its a wonder that the truth screeners on the internet havent flagged this all as disinformation.So, as a public service, I will help do their job for them and review just the facts, maam, using the official government data, on how after five years the tax cuts have impacted jobs, the economy, tax fairness and the simplicity of the tax code.1. The Trump tax law was one of the biggest middle-class tax cuts in U.S. history. The Trump Treasury Department calculated that the average family of four saves roughly $2,000 a year. This means, sorry, Joe, repealing the bill would raise taxes for most families making less than $400,000. The House Budget Committee has estimated that the typical family will pay $1,500 more taxes annually if Biden repeals the Trump tax cut.MOM RIPS BIDEN ADMIN OVER ECONOMY AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: HARD TO LIVE IN JOE BIDENS AMERICA2. The Trump tax cuts vastly simplified the tax code for the majority of Americans. A major feature of the bill was to double the standard deduction from $12,500 to $25,000. As a result, prior to the Trump tax cuts, about one-third of tax filers had to itemize their deductions and keep track for the IRS of shoe boxes of receipts and other transactions related to mortgage payments, charitable deductions, interest payments and so on. Now nearly 90% of Americans – and almost all middle-and lower-income families – just check a box of the standard deduction.3. The Trump tax bill forces millionaires and billionaires in blue states to pay their fair share of taxes. One of the smartest features of the Trump bill was to cap the deduction of state and local taxes for the super-rich.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThis allowed millionaires and billionaires in blue states like New York and California to pay billions of dollars less in taxes than an equally wealthy tax filer in low-tax states like Florida and Texas. The old law encouraged states and localities to raise their taxes because it shifted the federal tax burden on to residents of other states.4. The Trump tax cut expanded the economy and business activity, which ended up raising tax revenues. A study by Heritage Foundation fiscal analyst Preston Brashers examines the impact of the Trump tax cuts after four years and found that the policy changes actually raised more revenue in its first four years than the Congressional Budget Office predicted without the tax cut.The House Budget Committee similarly concluded in a May 2024 analysis: The Trump tax cuts resulted in economic growth that was a full percentage point above CBOs forecast. Revenues were $200 billion a year more than was predicted before the tax cuts.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP5. The rich paid more, not less taxes after the Trump tax cut. Biden says continually that the major reason the deficit has exploded is that Trump cut taxes on the rich. Wrong. Five years after the Trump tax cuts, the IRS own data show the top 1% of earners in America saw their percentage of total income taxes collected rise from 40% to 46% of the total in 2022. This was the largest share of taxes paid by the rich ever.The truth is, almost all the negative claims that Democrats made in opposing the Trump tax cuts in 2017 were proven to be fallacious. Rather than admit that they were wrong, theyve doubled down in their commitment to policies that would raise taxes on virtually every American corporation, small business, family and investor. Perhaps the theme for the Biden campaign should be Putting America Last.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEPHEN MOORE;Right
251;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-fox-calls-state-dept-abandon-obsession-dei-depoliticize-new-report-says;First on Fox: Calls for State Department to abandon obsession with DEI and depoliticize, new report says;The State Department’s practices of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring has led to potential inefficiencies in hiring and concerns about the quality of employees in the foreign service, according to a report from The Heritage Foundation.Ideologically driven bureaucrats at the State Department are severely undermining U.S. diplomacy by artificially engineering equal outcomes in hiring and personnel decisions, through overriding objective criteria, Simon Hankinson, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center and author of the report, told Fox News Digital.The world is on fire right now — as seen by the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Yet, the State Department is wasting limited resources on an agenda that does not advance American interests and is not supported by data, Hankinson, who also served as a foreign service officer, said.My report lays out how the State Department can return to core American values and implement processes that prioritize merit-based principles. The American people deserve better.OBAMA STATE DEPT BLOCKED FBI FROM ARRESTING SUPPORTERS OF IRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN US: EMAILSThe report focuses on the hiring practices of the Foreign Service, which provides personnel to the U.S. diplomatic services and consists of over 13,000 professionals, insisting that the service must select its employees through objective, meritocratic criteria and are accountable to the president.We haven’t seen the report, but we welcome a diversity of viewpoints, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital.State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel argued during a press conference Thursday that the department welcomes diverse points of view and believes it makes us a stronger department, and it makes and leads to a stronger policymaking process.The secretary and department leadership will continue to seek out a wide range of views because we think it improves our policymaking process, he said in response to reports a career State Department official had quit over disagreements with a recently published report claiming Israel was not impeding humanitarian aid in Gaza.Hankinson lays out what he determines are a few myths about hiring and staffing in the State Department, namely that there’s a lack of racial and gender diversity, which the department resists, that structural barriers prevent minorities from entering the Foreign Service, that promotions are biased, that the department has a hostile work environment for minorities at State and they leave because of that hostile climate.HAMAS GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY UNDER MICROSCOPE AS QUESTIONS CONTINUE OVER NUMBER OF DEATHSAnother career official who quit over the Israel-Gaza internal disputes noted that while she found discussion on this topic unwelcome, it ran counter to the open discussion and welcome dissent on virtually every other topic over her 18 years with State, according to The Washington Post.The report argues that by separating the department’s 25,000 employees into their various intersectional components, the DEIA baseline seems intended to serve efforts by the department to achieve equity through race and sex-based preferences. (The A stands for accessibility.)According to the report, 35% of the current 26,000 civil service and foreign service employees are identified as minority, citing the State Department’s permanent workforce diversity data as of Sept. 30, 2023. Additionally, the report claims racial percentages within the workforce are within 10% of the national levels.The report quotes former State Department Director of Recruitment Woody Staeben as arguing eight years ago that the number of White officers among new hires had dropped by 30%, but that it will take much longer for the overall figure to change because the average Foreign Service career spans 27 years, meaning that issues with the makeup of the workforce reflect a delayed reaction to the makeup from years prior.STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS CONDOLENCES FOR DEATH OF IRANS PRESIDENT IN ‘BAFFLING’ MOVE, HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER SAYSThe report’s most striking point — that the department stresses employees are held accountable to the president — derives from perceived resistance within the State Department to former President Trump’s policies, such as efforts to control illegal immigration, leading the report to accuse the State Department of having an increasingly left-leaning bias and arguing the bias derives from universities.Although there are approximately 65 appointees at State, (not including ambassadors), they are often unable to change policy in line with the vision of the President, due to bureaucratic inertia, ignorance of how things are done, and resistance from entrenched career officials, the report says. This systemic paralysis is a fundamental challenge to the principle that elections should result in policy changes.The most significant issue the report finds is the lack of emphasis on the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT), which former Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley dismissed as having zero correlation to being a successful diplomat while more subjective oral exams helped test for racists, or sexists, or homophobes or ableists, which she determined as things that we need to be screening for.Those who have the vast majority of senior [foreign service] positions are primarily European American men. … You don’t get to 87% of one group that is not 87% of the population and feel confident that all of those selections were made on the basis of merit, Abercrombie-Winstanley said during her 2023 testimony on diversity practices at the State Department.STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUES ‘WORLDWIDE CAUTION’ ALERT FOR AMERICANS OVERSEASThe report stressed the value of standardized tests, such as the SAT for college, the MCAT for medical school and the LSAT for law school, as indicators for success throughout a career in the given field.It stands to reason that accepting applicants with lower FSOT scores will lead to lower performance as those officers move through their careers, both to their own and to the service’s detriment, according to the report. The State Department’s Board of Examiners reportedly did not conduct any empirical research to determine whether higher FSOT scores correlated with career performance before deciding to de-emphasize the test.CLICK HERE TO FOR THE FOX NEWS APPTherefore, the report concluded that Congress should pass a new Foreign Service Act to restore the FSOT as a required entrance exam for the service, limit total annual recruitment into the service via fellowship and other channels that avoid the test, make promotion blind to race, sex and other immutable and irrelevant characteristics and require comprehensive annual reports from the State Department on the written and oral exams.The annual reports would include demographic breakdown, educational attainment, pass rates, language skills, state of origin and number of attempts of all test-takers. Additionally, the State Department should seek to eliminate duplicative and unvaluable positions and effectively dismantle the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.;Right

JAMES MEASE, PATRIOT WITH PASSION FOR ‘LOVE APPLES’Anderson was born to means on a southern plantation but raised in a society devastated by war.It was also a society that suffered a tragic loss of human capital. Male capital. More than 1 in 5 military-age men (about 22%) in the Confederacy were killed in the Civil War, according to several sources.Southerners responded with indomitable spirit. Anderson was among a new era of entrepreneurs and innovators burning with determination to overcome adversity.Many of them were women, later represented by the fictional icon OHara.Anderson built apartments in Alabama, herded cattle in California and, following a winter trolley trip in New York City, devised a way to keep the world truckin in a tempest.She didnt have a father, she didnt have a husband, and she didnt have a son.She didnt have a father, she didnt have a husband, and she didnt have a son, one of her descendants, Sara-Scott Wingo, said in a 2017 interview with NPR.And the world was kind of run by men back then.Cattle calls & trolley carsMary Elizabeth Anderson was born on Feb. 19, 1866, on Burton Hill Plantation in Greene County, Alabama, to John C. and Rebecca Anderson.The Civil War had ended only 10 months earlier. The conflict was followed by the economic hardship and social upheaval of the Reconstruction Era across the South.The Anderson family suffered its own loss in 1870. Mary was just four years old when her father died.Mary and her sister, Fannie, and mother continued to live off the proceeds from his estate, the late Dr. J. Fred Olive III, of the University of Alabama Birmingham, wrote for the Encyclopedia of Alabama.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO NEVER FLINCHED IN THE FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE, ABIGAIL ADAMSThe Anderson women moved to Birmingham and entered the real-estate business, building the Fairmont Apartments at the corner of 21st Street and Highland Avenue.Mary Anderson also sought adventure and/or fortune out west.In 1893, at age 27, she moved to Fresno, California, where she spent several years managing a vineyard and cattle ranch before returning to Birmingham.She also visited New York City in late 1902 and experienced northern weather, apparently for the first time.While riding an electric streetcar during a snowstorm, she noticed that the motorman operating the streetcar was shivering, Charles Carey wrote in the 2002 book, American Inventors, Entrepreneurs and Business Visionaries.She noticed that the motorman operating the streetcar was shivering … He was constantly having to slide open the middle pane so he could wipe off the glass.The author also wrote, Snow was sticking to the windshield, and he was constantly having to slide open the middle pane so he could wipe off the glass.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO MADE PRESCRIPTIONS SAFER, DEBORAH ADLER, INSPIRED BY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR GRANDMAThe driver’s vision was impaired, as was his operational ability. The situation created safety hazards for both pedestrians and passengers.The winter ride exposed to the winter elements was likely miserable for a woman who spent her life in warmth and sunshine surrounded by Alabama bougainvillea and California farmland.Upon returning to Alabama, writes Carey, Anderson gave much thought to the motorman’s plight.‘Teased and laughed at’Anderson spent the next several months devising a way for drivers to clean their windshields while still inside their vehicles.She appears to have possessed an innate mechanical capability. There is no indication that Anderson ever trained as a mechanic or engineer.But she emerged with a clever mechanism that displayed many of the hallmarks of windshield wipers today. She applied for the window cleaning device patent in June 1903 and received it in Nov. 1903.Modern windshield wipers operate via powerful little motors that deliver high torque at low speed with the twist of a knob. Drivers, with Andersons original device, operated wipers manually with a lever.The lever caused a spring-loaded arm with a rubber blade to swing across the windshield and then back again to [its] original position, thus removing droplets of rain or flakes of snow from the windshield’s surface, noted Lemelson-MIT, a program devoted to innovation, in its online biography of Anderson.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SERVED AS THE MODEL FOR HUCK FINN, ‘KIINDLY YOUNG HEATHEN’ TOM BLANKENSHIPIt is simply necessary for [the driver] to take hold of the handle and turn it in one direction or the other to clean the pane, reads the patent application.Similar devices had been made earlier, Lemelson-MIT noted. But Anderson’s was the first that actually worked.Andersons wiper worked. But it didnt sell.The inventor was teased and laughed at by many people because of her idea for the windshield wipers, said MIT-Lemelson.Anderson ran into a stonewall of doubt and opposition from the transportation industry and auto titans.We regret to state we do not consider it to be of such commercial value as would warrant our undertaking its sale, said one rejection letter from the Canadian firm of Dinning and Eckenstein.Anderson was teased and laughed at by many people because of her idea for the windshield wipers.Through no fault of her own, her invention was simply ahead of its time, and other companies and entrepreneurs were able to profit off her original ideas, reports the National Inventors Hall of Fame.A vision with rhythmMary Anderson died on June 27, 1953, at her summer home in Monteagle, Tennessee.She was 87 years old and is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Birmingham.Anderson was a widely known Birmingham resident and owner of the Fairmont Apartments, said her obituary in the Birmingham Post-Herald.Her rights to the patent expired in 1920 – just as autos were exploding in popularity and the need to operate them safely in bad weather grew more obvious even to auto titans.In 1922, Cadillac began building cars with windshield wipers as a standard feature, reports the National Inventors Hall of Fame — which inducted Anderson in 2011.The rest of the automotive industry followed suit not long after.Anderson lived long enough to see the world embrace the vision she had as a young woman in New York City in 1902.Windshield wipers today are found on almost every vehicle in the world — planes, trains and automobiles.Theyre on boats and trolleys too.Windshield wipers clapping time/I was holdin’ Bobby’s hand in mine. — Me and Bobby McGeeWindshield wipers are frontline troops in defense of public safety.

Heres how;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!If President Joe Biden wins, your taxes will go up. It doesn’t matter if you’re a millionaire or middle class: the president has promised to raise taxes on every American who pays them. This would be bad for families struggling with inflation, bad for the economy, and it would be a massive expansion of the government at the last time we need it.Biden recently said that if he is re-elected, he will let the entire 2017 Trump tax cut expire. And contrary to Biden’s claims about that law, it was a huge tax cut for everyone, with the largest percentage reduction going to the middle class.The Trump tax cuts also reduced our business tax from the highest in the developed world, to far closer to the average, and cut taxes on small businesses to an average of less than 20%. This was good for investment, and it helped lead to the fastest wage growth in two decades.BIDENS WAR ON ENERGY WILL COST AMERICANS JOBS, WORSEN INFLATION, MONTANA OFFICIALS SAYBiden wants to reverse all these benefits and increase taxes by a devastating $5 trillion. In April, he pledged, That [Trump] tax cut is going to expire. If I’m reelected, it’s going to stay expired. This would represent the largest tax increase in history and would violate the president’s oft-repeated pledge never to raise taxes on the middle class.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThis proposed Biden tax hike would crush working families and add over $2,200 to the median American’s tax bill. What’s more, as business taxes go up at home, companies will be more likely to ship jobs overseas, meaning lower pay and fewer opportunities for Americans.Biden says his tax hike will only affect millionaires, billionaires and massive corporations. But that’s simply not true. Instead of crafting our nation’s tax policy based on growing the government, we ought to be guided by proven results and letting Americans keep the money that they earned — not the government.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Trump tax cuts worked and led to one of the greatest economies in history. The Biden tax hike would undue all of that, hurting our economy and our families.The good news is this doesn’t have to happen.

It’s up to us to make sure that doesn’t happen and that Trump tax cuts are extended.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. TOM COTTON;Right

Theres not ‘woke’ in the military. Theres ‘woke’ at the top, Trump said during the sit-down interview with hosts Pete Hegseth, Will Cain and Rachel Campos-Duffy.They want there to be woke, but these guys arent meant for woke. I would fire them. You cant have a woke military. You said it so great... You need people that want to win. They want to win wars. Thats what their purpose is, to win wars, not to be woke… but we do have great military.ARMY MAKES PROGRAM TO SHAPE UP OVERWEIGHT RECRUITS PERMANENT AS IT FIGHTS ONGOING RECRUITING CRISISThe official Facebook page for the U.S. Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare Command was mocked this weekend for marking the start of Pride Month.Backlash to the post surged when it was highlighted on the popular Libs of TikTok page on X, formerly known as Twitter. The post had no caption and included a photo with rainbow designs that read, NSW. Dignity. Service. Respect. Equality. Pride.Those are not the colors I care about. The colors I care about are red, white, and blue, Fox News Pete Hegseth told Ainsley Earhardt on Monday.We all wore green together. We all bleed red together. Who we slept with is not the issue... The issue is how good are you at your job? And are you being promoted because youre the best rifleman, or youre the best pilot, or youre the best tank commander? Not are you the first to this or are you the first that? And thats the story I tell time and time again.Libs of TikTok shared the post to X on Saturday, writing, The Navy SEALs have gone woke. Our elite special forces. This is terrifying.The post prompted a swarm of backlash from critics concerned about how the militarys priorities have impacted its military readiness as recruitment continues to be a struggle across nearly all the branches.I talked to dozens and dozens of actively serving men and women, junior enlisted high-ranking officers, and they all said the same thing, Hegseth said. Were walking on eggshells. Theres no accountability. The standards are being lowered, slowly eroded to conform to woke Marxist ideologies the Democrat politicians have pushed into the Pentagon. Pentagon should be the biggest meritocracy in the world. Instead, its a social experiment.BIDEN ADMINS MILITARY RECRUITING AND RETENTION CRISIS A SELF-INFLICTED WOUND. HERES HOW TO REVERSE COURSEMeanwhile, the Army, Air Force and Navy all missed their recruitment goals last year, prompting concern among critics who blame far-left ideologues who prioritize woke agendas over military readiness.The Army announced earlier this year the service is cutting its force by about 24,000 in a restructuring that it says will help the service fight in future wars.The almost 5% of jobs cut will mostly affect posts that have remained empty and not actual soldiers, and stem from counterinsurgency positions, cavalry squadrons, Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams and security force assistance brigades, which are used to train foreign forces.The U.S. military missed its recruiting goals in 2023 by 41,000, going into the new year facing a recruiting crisis, a Pentagon official said in December.A commander-in-chief needs to be focused on winning the wars we fight, and that means installing leadership at the Pentagon who are laser-focused on that, Hegseth said.Unfortunately, the incentives for generals under the Biden administration and the Obama administration was to conform to ideologies of leftist politicians who were ramming stuff into the Pentagon that has nothing to do with winning wars.What is your gender? What is your race? DEI, CRT, are we driving electric tanks? Are we saving the climate with the military? None of that is important to the men and women who I served with. We were focused on succeeding in the mission we were given, he continued.The Pentagon likes to say our diversity is our strength. What a bunch of garbage. In the military, our diversity is not our strength. Our unity is our strength, and we need a commander in chief that understands that. Donald Trump certainly does. Getting woke out will go a long way in making sure were the top in the world.Fox News Stephen Sorace, Anders Hagstrom and the Associated Press contributed to this report.;Right

But that is not what’s happening this election year. Those bedrock tenets of democracy are being tested in a way we haven’t seen since the Civil War. It’s a test for the candidates, for those of us in the media, and for all of us as citizens, Stephanopoulos said.He warned that no other presidential candidate in history had faced a criminal trial, and added, No American president has faced hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for business fraud, defamation, and sexual abuse.At the glitzy Washington D.C. gala the night before, Biden told reporters that the stakes in the presidential race couldnt be higher.Move past the horse race numbers and the gotcha moments and the distractions and the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics, and focus on what’s actually at stake, Biden said. I think in your hearts, you know whats at stake. The stakes couldn’t be higher.CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTUREStephanopoulos also sparred with Trump lawyer Will Scharf on Sunday after the attorney argued the Manhattan case was politically motivated.There’s no evidence here of that, the ABC host said, responding to Scharfs argument that President Biden was involved in the prosecution of Trump. Sir, there’s no – there’s not – Im not going to let you continue to say that. There’s just zero evidence of that.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWe’re going to vigorously challenge this case on appeal. I don’t think President Trump is going to end up being subject to any sentence whatsoever. And we look forward to getting this case into the – into the next court and taking this again all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to vindicate President Trump’s rights, Scharf said.;Right
260;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/android-banking-trojan-masquerades-google-play-steal-your-data;Android banking trojan masquerades as Google Play to steal your data;Criminals constantly develop new ways to scam people, and their latest tactic involves infecting Android phones with malware to access banking information and other details. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Cyble have discovered a new malware, dubbed Antidot, which masquerades as a Google Play update application. It displays fake Google Play update pages in multiple languages and captures sensitive information.GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HEREHow does this malware enter your Android?As detailed by Cyble , Antidote is a Trojan – malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program. In this case, it impersonates the Google Play Store (the default app market for downloading and updating apps on Android phones) and captures your important data.Antidot enters your Android phone by tricking you into sideloading it as an APK (Android Package Kit). APK is the file format that Android uses to distribute and install applications. When you sideload an app, you’re manually installing an APK file on your Android device, which is not obtained through the Google Play Store. You won’t find it on the Play Store because Google makes sure to keep most of the malicious apps off its platform. However, you may come across it on third-party app stores or other less legitimate sources.The malware can also enter your phone through phishing emails and text messages. For example, you might receive an email claiming you’ve won something (a lottery, a phone, etc.). You open the email and click on the link, and either nothing happens or you are taken to a dummy site. However, malware has been downloaded and installed on your phone.VOICE CLONING IS THE NEW WEAPON IN SCAMMERS’ ARSENAL FOR FAMILY EMERGENCY SCHEMESHow does the Antidot trojan work?Once the malware is installed on your Android phone, it displays a fake update page featuring a Continue button that takes you to the Accessibility settings. Antidot relies on the Accessibility services to carry out its malicious activities as they allow it to gain complete control over your phone.The trojan displays fake update pages in various languages, including German, French, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Romanian and English, indicating that it is targeting Android users in these language-speaking regions.SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICESAfter gaining access to your phone’s accessibility settings, it can access whatever information it wants, whether it’s collecting contacts and text messages, harvesting credentials, locking and unlocking the device, or forwarding calls.To steal passwords and other credentials, Antidot uses a sneaky trick called an overlay attack. When you open your bank app on your phone, the malware loads a fake website that looks exactly like the real bank app and covers it up. When you type in your login details, the hackers capture them, and they can then steal your money, commit fraud or even steal your identity with enough information.If the malware doesn’t have a fake website for an app, it uses another trick called  keylogging , which captures everything you type on your Android smartphone, including your passwords.‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANS10 ways you can protect yourself from the Android banking trojanWhile a trojan is hard to detect and can be dangerous once it enters your phone, there are several things you can do to protect your data.1) Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be vigilant about emails, phone calls or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request.2) Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but it’s not enough to stop all malicious software. Historically, Play Protect hasn’t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams . Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices .3) Download apps from reliable sources: Its important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device.4) Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft .5) Monitor your accounts: If you think you have been affected by the banking trojan, regularly review your bank statements, credit card statements and other financial accounts for any unauthorized activity. If you notice any suspicious transactions, report them immediately to your bank or credit card company.6) Enable SMS notifications for your bank accounts: By enabling SMS notifications, you can monitor your accounts for any unauthorized transactions.7) Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA is an extra shield that prevents hackers from accessing your accounts.8) Use a password manager: A password manager can help you create and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password theft.9) Regularly update your device’s operating system and apps: Keeping your software up to date is crucial as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by trojans.10) Be wary of granting permissions: Carefully review the permissions requested by apps. If an app asks for more access than it needs for its functionality, it could be a red flag.ANDROID USERS AT RISK AS BANKING TROJAN TARGETS MORE APPSKurt’s key takeawaysStaying one step ahead of cybercriminals is a constant challenge. The emergence of the Antidot trojan is a stark reminder that our vigilance must be as innovative as the threats we face. It’s not just about safeguarding our devices, it’s about protecting our digital existence. Remember, the power to prevent such intrusions largely rests in our hands. By adopting the protective measures outlined, from scrutinizing every app’s permissions to embracing robust security solutions, we can fortify our digital fortresses. Let’s not make it easy for the scammers.In what ways do you think technology companies could improve their security measures to better protect users from malware like Antidot?

261;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/35-years-after-tiananmen-square-massacre-why-never-forget;35 years after Chinas Tiananmen Square massacre: Why we must never forget;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!The voices of the brave individuals who perished 35 years ago in the Tiananmen Square massacre continue to echo across our collective conscience.On that day, the People’s Liberation Army, acting on the orders of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) leadership, murdered and injured thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters calling for political reform and an end to corruption.The image of a lone protester using only his body to confront a row of tanks instantly became an enduring global symbol of resistance against oppression.It was a day of immense tragedy, described as a bloodbath in the center of a world capital. The massacre shocked the international community, while also highlighting humanity’s innate desire for liberty.BIDEN ADMIN SLAMMED AS GRANTING ‘MAJOR COUP’ TO CHINA AFTER TOP OFFICIALS VISIT ON TIANANMEN MASSACRE DATEHowever, compounding this tragedy is the fact that today, most people under the age of 40 in 21st-century China have little to no understanding of the events that unfolded on June 4, 1989.As reported by Radio Free Asia, educators are still forbidden from teaching about it, references to it are instantly removed from China’s heavily censored internet, and even public memorials for the victims are strictly prohibited.There is one clear reason why the CCP has tried to wipe this dark chapter in China’s history from its public discourse: fear.The shocking loss of innocent life, and the protests leading up to it, embody an unyielding demand for democracy and human rights – values that directly challenge President Xi Jinpings centralized and increasingly oppressive rule. Xi and the rest of the CCP believe that by erasing the memory of Tiananmen, they can stifle dissent and silence calls for freedom – and, to some extent, they have succeeded.TIANANMEN SQUARE: TAIWAN VIGIL REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF CHINA MASSACREThis is precisely why we cannot allow the memory of Tiananmen to fade away. It is why we have come together to amplify the voices demanding democracy for China, ensuring that the courage and sacrifices of those who stood against tyranny are never forgotten.Nearly a decade before that fateful day, the United States began engaging in normalization efforts with Beijing, believing its integration into the global economy would lead to greater civic freedoms for its people. Both Democratic and Republican administrations achieved some success in deepening diplomatic ties and widening people-to-people contacts and exchange programs, and U.S. multinationals reaped significant profits in the China market.But, they were wrong. The strategic gamble that economic growth and global integration would lead to improvements in human rights and neighborly relations was a fatal error, one whose victims are the Chinese people themselves.In recent years, the Chinese government has only gotten worse. Xi has intensified his control over his people while extending his nation’s authoritarian reach across borders through brazen acts of transnational repression.TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE MASTERMIND KNOWN AS THE BUTCHER OF BEIJING DIESHe has helped turn his country into an Orwellian surveillance state with formidable economic and military power, trampling over human rights with impunity, bullying its neighbors, and presenting itself as an alternative to democratic governance.In response, the United States has more recently shifted its approach to addressing relations with China to prioritize national security over economic interests. We are diversifying our supply chains, limiting China’s access to technologies and products that could further enhance its economic and military capacity, and strengthening our defense alliances across the Indo-Pacific. While successive recent administrations have taken important action in this regard, it has often been the Congress that has led the way.As we’ve learned before, this national security focus, while important, must not crowd out our focus on human rights. We must not overlook the aspirations and dignity of the Chinese people, who continue to strive for greater freedoms and economic opportunities in their own country.The concerns of the United States lie squarely with Xi and his government, not the people of China, and we must continue our staunch support for them in their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Doing so is both a moral obligation and a strategic necessity for building stable international relations and bolstering our national security.CHINAS SILENCING OF TIANANMEN TRIBUTES EXTENDS TO HONG KONGOur commitment to human rights around the world only holds weight when we boldly denounce violations wherever and whenever they occur, and take action. By uniting with a resolute voice at home, and drawing wisdom and strength from the lessons of history, we can pave the way for a more dignified and prosperous future for all people across the globe.This unity of purpose should clearly convey our nation’s support for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom against oppressive regimes, such as that of Xi, and forcefully condemn efforts to censor information, rewrite history, and suppress the truth about mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.This is precisely what I aim to achieve by introducing a bipartisan resolution honoring the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.This legislation represents a united call for justice, not only for the tragic events that transpired 35 years ago, but also for Beijing’s ongoing human rights abuses today, including the brutal repression of Tibetan and Uyghur communities. It highlights the systematic erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong and condemns Xi’s widespread use of transnational repression, which targets Chinese diaspora communities and activists globally.HONG KONG UNIVERSITY SAYS PILLAR OF SHAME STATUE HONORING TIANANMEN SQUARE DEAD MUST COME DOWNBy shedding light on these issues, we can underscore the urgent need to hold the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its human rights abuses and to counter Xis attempts to undermine international norms and threaten global security.In commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre, we honor the courageous spirit of those who embody what Nobel laureate and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo called the enduring human quest for freedom, be it in China or anywhere else in the world.We see that spirit in the people of Taiwan and their newly elected president, Dr. Lai Ching-te, who share the very same democratic aspirations as the thousands of peaceful Chinese protesters who were killed and injured on that tragic day in 1989.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWe ask our fellow Americans to join us in paying tribute to the heroes of Tiananmen Square by recognizing the sacrifices they made in pursuit of liberty, dignity, and self-determination.Together, through our shared support for democracy and human rights, we can give voice to those silenced by the PRC and ensure that the legacy of Tiananmen continues to inspire generations to come.;Right

Now, theres not one tyrant. Were all a tyrant because, hey, look, its my will, its my desire. And as long as I dont harm you, Ive got the freedom to do whatever I want. And then youve got a society of little tyrants who have no sense of cohesion or of a real common good.Philosophers of ancient Greece and the Christian tradition, Barron said, show that the purpose of government really is to make us good, and it has something to do with virtue. And that freedom is not, as youre saying, simply doing what I want. … Its actually a kind of disciplining of your desire to make the achievement of virtue possible.VATICAN DOCUMENT ON MODERN ISSUES SHOWS HOW STUPID IT IS TO SEE CHURCH AS LEFT OR RIGHT: BISHOP BARRONDeneen is the author of Why Liberalism Failed, which former President Obama praised in 2018. While Obama disagreed with many of the books conclusions, he said it offered cogent insights into the loss of meaning and community that many in the West feel.The book makes the case that liberalism failed because it succeeded, that the understanding of liberty as freedom from obstacles has led to a breakdown of society at every level, including the family and social institutions.At another point in the interview, Deneen decried the breakdown of contact between elite Americans, those who hold more political and economic power than most of the country, and ordinary citizens.I think the contemporary elites coming out of institutions like mine mix very little with ordinary people, Deneen said.THE MOST POPULAR CATHOLIC OUTSIDE THE VATICAN: BISHOP BARRONThat disconnect involves, in part, the political divide, condemned by populists as elites versus deplorables, but theres also a kind of non-prejudiced form, which is just not having any contact, Deneen said.It involves going from upper middle class to upper class suburbs to the best schools to Notre Dame to living with your graduate friends in Brooklyn and then going to live in wealthy suburbs and retiring in Florida, never mixing with ordinary people.The solution to the divide and the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few people could at some point require structural change, Deneen said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDeneen argued in his 2023 book, Regime Change: Toward a Postliberal Future, that America is headed for a fundamental transformation. His book advocated for a peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order in which existing political forms can remain in place, as long as a fundamentally different ethos informs those institutions and the personnel who populate key offices and positions.;Right

I dont make it alone. Weve all made it, with our heroines who gave us our homeland, with our mothers, our daughters and our granddaughters.The former Mexico City mayor said that her two competitors – Xóchitl Gálvez and Jorge Álvarez Máynez – had called her and conceded.The National Electoral Institute’s president said Sheinbaum had between 58.3% and 60.7% of the vote, according to a statistical sample. Opposition candidate Gálvez had between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote, and Álvarez Máynez had between 9.9% and 10.8% of the vote. Sheinbaums Morena Party was also projected to hold majorities in both chambers of Congress.SHEINBAUM FACES HUGE HURDLES FROM POWERFUL CARTELSPresident Biden said Monday that I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum on her historic election as the first woman President of Mexico and that he looks forward to working closely with President-elect Sheinbaum in the spirit of partnership and friendship that reflects the enduring bonds between our two countries.I also congratulate the Mexican people for conducting a nationwide successful democratic electoral process involving races for more than 20,000 positions at the local, state, and federal levels, Biden added.Sheinbaum, the AP reports, will also be the first Jewish leader of the overwhelmingly Catholic country.She will start her six-year term on Oct. 1.

Look at the billions of taxpayer dollars President Joe Biden is pouring into community organizations in disadvantaged communities to tip the election scales.The community organizer who became president, Barack Obama, was a master at machine politics, using federal tax dollars to turn community organizations – left-wing not-for-profits – into a fifth estate. Their staffs, paid using taxpayer money but not tied to government rules, could hit the streets at election time and build turnout. Biden has scaled up Obamas playbook, using billions of dollars instead of mere millions.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made headlines recently with the discovery that in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded a $50 million environmental justice grant to the Climate Justice Alliance. Capito is distressed to learn that the Climate Justice Alliance vows the path to climate justice travels through a free Palestine.BIDEN ADMIN PRIORITIZES $900 MILLION FOR GREEN SCHOOL BUSES AS ILLITERACY PLAGUES US SCHOOLSIn fact, Climate Justice Alliance serves up a full agenda of radical activities, including fighting political oppression and placing race, gender, and class at the center of its climate solutions.But $50 million for the Climate Justice Alliance is a drop in the bucket.Had members of Congress read the Inflation Reduction Act before passing it – a novel idea – they would know the law provides $2.8 billion to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants, (Section 60201). Thats a license to hand out walking-around money to many political activists, not just the Climate Justice Alliance.Another recipient: the New York Immigration Coalition, which describes itself as a coalition of immigrant and refugee organizations pushing for more government services and political clout.Same is true of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, another recipient. The words climate and environment dont appear anywhere on these groups websites or literature.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Bidens open border policies. Money may shore up support.Lawmakers may have assumed the money was for climate improvement, but the IRAs fine print allows the moolah to be used for facilitating engagement of marginalized communities in Local, State and Federal public processes, such as advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings. Translation: elections.How easy is it to get the dough? Piece of cake. The EPA says it wants to alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations. In short, no jumping through hoops.The money can only go to a disadvantaged community or a southern border town. There are 27,521 disadvantaged communities on the census map, according to Bidens Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which targets non-English speakers, people with diabetes, and other factors that mostly correspond to heavily minority populations. These communities customarily vote Democratic.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Bidens open border policies. Money may shore up support.During his first week as president, Biden announced the Justice40 initiative by executive order, requiring that 40% of many types of federal spending – not just EPA grants – must go to these disadvantaged communities.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe Department of Energy is spreading money to these disadvantaged communities, using what it calls community benefit plans and promising that application requirements will be intentionally flexible.The playbook started with the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, or Obamacare, authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hand out community transformation grants. Community Health Councils, a typical recipient, pledged that its mission was to advance social justice.It distributed 65% of the money to partner community groups that promoted voter engagement, conducted one-on-one education in the streets or led tenants rights, anti-fracking and anti-drilling efforts. And you thought the ACA was about covering the uninsured.A decade after Obama, Biden is tasking every agency and department of the federal government to promote voter engagement.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBidens community grants pale in size compared to the student debt cancellation vote-buying that now totals $620 billion.

266;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-progressives-cheering-trump-verdict-should-mourning-loss-instead;Democrats, progressives cheering Trump verdict should be mourning this loss instead;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!A Manhattan jury rendered its verdict on Donald Trump last week. The flimsy prosecution by District Attorney Alvin Bragg may have succeeded in harming Trump’s legal and political fortunes, especially in a close race. But it will come at the cost of unpredictable damage to our constitutional order.Once again, Democrats have sacrificed the institutions and norms that have buttressed our political stability to stop a single individual who threatens their vision of democracy.In last Thursday’s verdict, the jury unanimously agreed on a complicated set of facts that may well not add up to a criminal violation. It found that in 2016, Trump had paid porn star Stephanie Clifford (stage name, Stormy Daniels) $170,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair. That in itself does not violate the law.The jury must have agreed with Michael Cohen, Trump’s lawyer at the time, that Trump improperly filed these payments as legal expenses rather than as a contribution to his own presidential campaign. This might be a misdemeanor, worthy of a fine, but not by itself a felony.TRUMP V BIDEN: GUILTY VERDICT WONT SEAL THE DEAL FOR EITHER MAN. HERES WHAT WILL DELIVER A WINAnd the jury must have concluded that this bookkeeping error was secretly an attempt to enable some greater crime, such as violating federal campaign or tax law – even though federal authorities had not brought charges against Trump for the non-disclosure agreement payoff to Clifford.If this sounds complicated, it’s because it is – far beyond the abilities of a normal jury to understand. Trump will have strong grounds to appeal. Trial judge Juan Merchan may have erred in allowing the extensive, prejudicial testimony by Clifford, which had little relevance to accounting rules or campaign finance.Observers have already objected to Judge Merchan’s allowance of Clifford’s inflammatory testimony, his interruptions of Robert Costello’s impeachment of Cohen, and his bar on the appearance of Brad Smith (Trump’s expert on campaign law). Appeals courts have little interest in second-guessing a trial judge on evidentiary rulings, but Judge Merchan made several serious errors of law well-poised for reversal. For example, he allowed the prosecution to withhold the second, greater crime allegedly enabled by the bookkeeping shenanigans until the very end of the trial. This violated Trump’s constitutional right of clear notice of the charges so he could put on an adequate defense.In an equally serious mistake, Merchan allowed the Manhattan DA to enforce his personal version of federal election law. The Supreme Court has made clear in cases such as New York v. United States (1992), Printz v. United States (1997), and Arizona v. United States (2012), that the Constitution forbids state officers from prosecuting violations of federal law. The Constitution’s take care clause vests that authority only in the president and his subordinates.TRUMP GUILTY VERDICT REVEALS A DEMOCRAT PARTY THAT WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO WINYears could pass before Trump can take his appeals through the state appeals court system to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he would win solely on this last issue.In the meantime, the prosecution will have already wrought its destruction on our constitutional norms. First gone is the tradition of not prosecuting presidents after they have left office.In the 235-year history of the Republic, prosecutors both state and federal had left presidents alone. And this was not just because all presidents were as pure as the driven snow. Instead, elected executives had demonstrated the statesmanship to avoid using the criminal justice system to manipulate elections or punish their political rivals. Not only did Gerald Ford pardon Richard Nixon over Watergate, or George W. Bush leave Bill Clinton in peace despite the latter’s obvious perjury, but Donald Trump did not pursue Hillary Clinton for her routing of classified emails to her unsecured home computer network.DOES THE GUILTY VERDICT DESTROY TRUMP OR MAKE HIM EVEN STRONGER?Avoiding the temptation of criminalizing political differences is not just important to protect a stable electoral system, but to ensure an optimal president. The Constitution concentrates all of the executive power of the federal government in the president. It does this not because the Founders believed presidents would be perfect, but because they knew that only a single individual could act with the speed, decisiveness and energy necessary to respond to emergencies, protect the nation and wage war.If we allow any state attorney general or local district attorney to prosecute presidents – especially on the frivolous charges concocted by Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg – presidents will have to factor into their decision-making whether political rivals and opponents will turn to the courts to punish them. Presidents will worry about their litigation risk, rather than the risks to the nation.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe second norm gone is the rule of law, which at a minimum includes the idea that like cases must be treated alike. Bragg violated the rule of law by charging the former president with a crime – a bookkeeping misdemeanor upgraded to a felony by an alleged violation of federal election law – that had never been charged.People expect the courts to enforce the rule of law, but judges refuse to inquire into prosecutorial discretion – the principle that only the executive branch selects the cases to investigate. Courts cannot force prosecutors to drop cases because they have selected a specific defendant, nor can they force prosecutors to charge other defendants to ensure equality of treatment.The Trump case put on vivid display the principle that the most important protector of the rule of law are prosecutors and other members of the executive branch. They ensure that the law is applied equally in the choice of cases to bring and not bring.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt is for prosecutors to live up to the ideal that society punishes defendants for committing crimes, not simply for being unpopular. But in investigating Trump first and coming up with the crimes second, Bragg and his colleagues in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., have violated the rule of law.Progressives celebrating Trump’s conviction should instead be mourning the loss of the institutional norms that have served our nation so well for so long.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOO;Right
267;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/female-athletes-like-us-suffer-biden-admin-allowed-rewrite-title-ix;Female athletes like us will suffer if Biden admin is allowed to rewrite Title IX;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!There are bad ideas. And then there are bad ideas that hurt people.Seriously hurt a lot of people.The Biden administration’s decision to radically revise Title IX rules does more than attempt to redefine sex in American law. It absolutely guts equal opportunities for women – particularly female athletes like us – and seriously endangers their health and safety in the process.No wonder so many lawsuits have been filed in just the last couple of weeks to challenge these new changes.WOMEN UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S TITLE IX CHANGES FACE THE ‘EVISCERATION OF LEGAL WOMANHOOD,’ EXPERTS SAYBy changing the definition of sex to include gender identity, the administration seems determined to force all Americans to ignore scientific reality and embrace radical gender ideology.The administration is convinced that gender identity trumps biology when it comes to defining sex under Title IX. No amount of biological evidence will persuade them otherwise.Men are, on average, bigger, stronger and faster than women. When men and women collide on athletic courts and playing fields, it’s the women who usually get hurt. When they try to share the same restrooms and locker rooms, it’s usually the women who get taken advantage of and preyed upon.It’s the whole reason men have their own teams, and women have theirs. It’s why Title IX was created – to ensure crucial protections, fair circumstances and equal opportunities.SIX STATES SUE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER NEW TITLE IX PROTECTIONS FOR TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS SPORTSYet the administration chooses to ignore all of those realities – and pressure the rest of us to ignore them, too – accommodating men who want to identify as women, even if that pretense hurts the women themselves.Clearly, this administration – which makes a great show of commitment to women’s best interests – isn’t really interested in women’s rights at all.They’re certainly not interested in protecting women’s privacy. Under the new regulations, women and girls will be forced to undress, sleep or shower next to males. All restrooms, locker rooms and even hotel rooms (on school trips) will be effectively co-ed, to accommodate those who identify as the opposite sex.The Biden administration is just as disinterested in protecting women’s safety. It’s not safe to put men and women in the same locker rooms, restrooms and hotel rooms. Things happen that could happen almost anywhere but are sure to happen a lot more easily and often when women don’t have the protections of privacy.BIDEN’S WOKE TITLE IX RULE IS SO INSANE, IT FORCES KIDS AND TEACHERS TO LIEAnd, finally – despite what they say – Biden administration officials are not remotely interested in protecting women’s sports. If the heightened risk and embarrassment of losing their privacy doesn’t keep many girls and women out of athletic competition, the forced integration of male athletes who identify as female into their teams and events surely will.Despite disingenuous claims by the Biden administration that these new regulations won’t impact women’s athletics, it’s clear that they will, in fact, have a devastating effect.There’s just no way to redefine sex in the laws regulating sports without affecting sports. And, given that the administration has been saying for years that men must be welcomed into women’s athletics, it makes no sense that they won’t seize this chance to enforce that agenda.The effects are sure to be devastating for women and girls all over America, too many of whom are already seeing their hard work and cherished dreams fall victim to the new fairness. We both know this from personal experience.HOW BIDENS NEW TITLE IX REGULATIONS EVISCERATE THE DEFINITION OF SEXMadison competed in cross-country and track and field for Idaho State University, where she was repeatedly forced to compete against a male athlete identifying as a woman – and lost every race against that athlete. After a lawsuit was filed to challenge Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) attorneys helped her to intervene in the case.Lainey played soccer at West Virginia State University. In her state, a middle-school male athlete competing on a girls’ track team beat almost 300 female athletes in three years – and denied two girls spots in the women’s conference championship. ADF attorneys assisted Lainey to intervene in a lawsuit filed against West Virginia’s Save Women’s Sports Act.Both of those lawsuits are ongoing, and one or both could reach the U.S. Supreme Court soon. Meanwhile, numerous other lawsuits – many filed by ADF on behalf of students, teachers and other female athletes – are directly challenging the Biden administration’s new rule.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWe have taken this stand because – in school after school, state after state – the impact of the Biden administration’s agenda has been the same: frustration and disappointment, broken dreams and lost opportunities.As former University of Kentucky athlete Riley Gaines recently told a U.S. House oversight subcommittee, By redefining sex discrimination to include ‘gender identity’ in regulation, the Biden administration will be eradicating female-only sports, spaces and scholarships at institutions receiving federal funding.In all of these ways and many others, the aggressive effort to rewrite Title IX threatens the most basic rights and protections of American women. Their safety, their privacy, their potential to participate competitively in school sports – all of these are endangered by the changes being forced on us by an administration that thinks it can change reality.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden officials seem convinced their drastic revisions will raise awareness of their preferred ideology among all Americans.But – in reality – they’ve just lowered the boom on women.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MADISON KENYONCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAINEY ARMISTEADLainey Armistead is a second-year student at Stetson University College of Law and a former team captain for the West Virginia State University women’s soccer team.Both athletes are represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (@ADFLegal).;Right

And they hope their discovery leads to a new diagnosis that can provide answers to families.Those with the condition have a constellation of issues, which also include short stature, small heads, seizures and low muscle mass, said the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Medicine on Friday.We were struck by how common this disorder is when compared with other rare diseases linked to a single gene, said Ernest Turro of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, senior author of the study.CHILDREN WITH INHERITED DEAFNESS HEAR FOR FIRST TIME THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPYSyndromes like these can go unnoticed because the traits are sometimes so subtle doctors can’t recognize them by just looking at patients, said Dr. Charles Billington, a pediatric geneticist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the study.So certainly this wasn’t something that we necessarily had a name for, he said. We’re learning more about these syndromes that we recognize only once we are seeing the cause.Researchers said the mutations occurred in a small non-coding gene, meaning it doesn’t provide instructions for making proteins. Until now, all but nine of the nearly 1,500 genes known to be linked to intellectual disability in general are protein-coding genes. Most large genetic studies so far have used a sequencing technology that typically leaves out genes that dont code for proteins.This study used more comprehensive whole-genome sequencing data from 77,539 people enrolled in the British 100,000 Genomes Project, including 5,529 with an intellectual disability. The rare mutations researchers found in the gene, called RNU4-2, were strongly associated with the potential to develop intellectual disability.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe finding opens the door to diagnoses for thousands of families, said study author Andrew Mumford, research director of the South West England NHS Genomic Medicine Service.More research is needed, Mumford said. How the mutation causes the disorder remains unclear and there is no treatment. But Billington said labs should be able to offer testing for this condition relatively quickly. And researchers said families should be able to find and support each other – and know they’re not alone.That can be incredibly comforting, Mumford said.;Right
269;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/health/ask-doctor-why-hands-swelling-what-should-do;Ask a doctor: Why are my hands swelling and what should I do about it?;If you notice your hands are swelling, it could be both uncomfortable and unsettling, but in most instances the cause could be situational — caused by factors such as temperature, exercise, diet, medications you’re taking or certain health conditions.You may notice your rings aren’t fitting correctly, among other things.To find out more about the condition, Fox News Digital asked two doctors what causes hand swelling and what can be done to treat it.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘WHY AM I HEARING MY HEARTBEAT IN MY EARS?’Here’s what you need to know.What causes hand swelling?Most commonly, hand swelling is due to fluid buildup in the soft tissue.Soft tissue swelling, or edema, is not always a cause for concern, and can occur with weather changes or fluid shifts in the body, said Amy Kehl, M.D., RhMSUS, a board-certified rheumatologist with Saint Johns Physician Partners in Santa Monica, California.Most patients observe some degree of soft tissue swelling or edema with hot weather and with exercise, according to Kehl.Fluid shifts can also occur with too much salt intake, she noted, which can lead to increased hand or foot swelling, she said.Certain medications can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet.Additionally, certain medications, such as blood pressure medications like amlodipine, steroids such as Prednisone or Medrol, or hormone treatments, can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet, Kehl added.What are the more serious causes of hand swelling?If a person notices an increase in hand or foot swelling that is not reversible or intermittent — or if the hand swelling is also accompanied by leg swelling with marked elevations in blood pressure or shortness of breath — medical attention should be sought, Kehl said.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO SWALLOW GUM?’A person should ensure they have had proper medical evaluation to assess both kidney and cardiac function, as hand or foot swelling can be an indicator of kidney dysfunction, protein loss in the urine, or cardiac dysfunction, she cautioned.Your doctor may order tests to assess your kidney function, urine studies or, in some cases, an echocardiogram.Diuretics may be needed to remove the excess fluid if it is related to cardiac dysfunction, she said.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO CRACK MY NECK OR BACK?’Another possible cause of fluid build-up is lymphedema, which can occur if the patient has had surgery, such as a lymph node resection for breast cancer treatment, according to Kehl.This may be treated with local lymphatic drainage treatments, arm elevation, compression sleeves and exercise, the doctor said.Patients should seek medical attention right away if new and asymmetric swelling and pain develops.Individuals should also be cognizant of other symptoms.Certainly, if the hand swelling is associated with joint pains, this may indicate an underlying inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, Kehl told Fox News Digital. Again, an examination may be warranted to distinguish soft tissue swelling from articular or joint swelling.Patients should also be aware if the swelling is asymmetric.This can be a sign of something more serious, such as a blood clot, and patients should seek medical attention right away if new and asymmetric swelling and pain develops, Kehl warned.ASK A DOCTOR: HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY POSTURE?If a patient notices hand swelling in association with facial or lip swelling, this warrants immediate medical attention, she said.What are some ways to reduce hand swelling?If the hand swelling is deemed to be due to benign causes, this is typically reversible, Kehl noted.For instance, to reduce hand swelling after exercising, elevating the hands and performing arm circles may be helpful to increase the blood flow to the hands, she said.Similarly, it may be necessary to review your medication list with your medical provider to identify any pharmaceutical culprits.Typically, with discontinuation of the offending medication, the swelling should subside, Kehl said.ASK A DOCTOR: HOW CAN I PREVENT HIGH CHOLESTEROL?Diet should also be monitored.Staying well-hydrated can help keep fluids circulating.Maintaining the proper balance of salt and water is important, and reducing salt intake and following a low-sodium diet may be advisable for some patients, the expert noted.Lifestyle changes, such as movement, can also be incorporated to help alleviate the swelling.Stretch both arms up, move your hands and wrists, and make fists several times, Beth Oller, M.D., a family physician with Rooks County Health Center in Stockton, Kansas, told Fox News Digital.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERRunning your hands under cool water may help, she said, and taking off jewelry or constricting clothes while exercising can also help prevent swelling due to temperature changes.Staying well-hydrated can also help keep fluids circulating, Oller added.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPregnancy is another common cause of swelling. In that case, Oller said that moving the extremities can help.If swelling in pregnancy occurs suddenly or is extreme, talk to your physician immediately, as this can be a symptom of elevated blood pressure, she also said.;Right

She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave (1850).Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in Feb. 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? speech (1852) and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass autobiography (1881).BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTHDouglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad.Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.She personally made about 13 trips into Maryland to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to about 70 more, according to the NPS.When the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Col. James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing and cooking aid.Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor of science degree, according to History.com.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEBRUARY 3, 1870, 15TH AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED, GRANTING BLACK MALES THE RIGHT TO VOTECarver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for, that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.Some of her famous written works include Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (1893) and Mob Rule in New Orleans (1900).Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, ALBERTA KING, ‘GAVE HER ALL FOR CHRIST’He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a masters and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans.

Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.From Kings opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.Explore Kings profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.War Poverty Segregation Voting LegacyMARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY1. WarThe idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America, King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.2. PovertyDuring the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLEThe members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.3. SegregationKing fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.He famously delivered his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.Just four days after Parks arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end, he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLKS ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: WE STILL HAVE A DREAMA federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.4. VotingKing advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.Kings involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nations first Black president.5. LegacyAs King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF USWe have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But Ive come to believe were integrating into a burning house, King said. Im afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And Im afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following Kings assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he brought it on himself.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.;Right

277;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-agrees-stop-sending-balloons-manure-trash-south-korea;North Korea agrees to stop sending balloons with manure, trash to South Korea;North Korea agreed to stop flying hundreds of balloons carrying trash and manure to South Korea, saying Sunday it launched the campaign to leave its neighbors to the south with enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel.The Associated Press reported that North Korea’s announcement came mere hours after South Korea said it would punish the North with an unbearable retaliation over its balloon activities and other provocations lately.Last week, North Korea flew hundreds of balloons with trash and manure toward South Korea, prompting the South’s military to mobilize chemical and explosive response teams to recover objects and debris in various parts of the country.The balloon campaign came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged his military scientists to overcome a failed satellite launch and continue developing space-based reconnaissance capabilities. He described those efforts as crucial for countering U.S. and South Korean military activities, state media said Wednesday.NORTH KOREA FLIES BALLOONS CARRYING GARBAGE OVER SOUTH KOREA FOLLOWING FAILED SATELLITE LAUNCHThe wire reported observers claims that South Korea was likely going to restart front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea, criticizing the country for violating human rights while also broadcasting world news and K-pop songs.North Korean leaders are sensitive to the broadcasts because most of the 26 million people living in the country do not have access to radio programs and foreign television.Kim Kang II, a North Korean vice defense minister, said Sunday that the country would temporarily suspend the balloon activities, adding they were a countermeasure against the South’s leafleting campaigns.We made the ROK (Republic of Korea) clans get enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel and how much effort is needed to remove the scattered wastepaper, Kim said in a statement carried by state media.NORTH KOREA TEST-FIRES SUSPECTED MISSILES AFTER US, SOUTH KOREA CONDUCT FIGHTER JET DRILLHe also said if South Korean activists send more anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons into North Korea again, they will resume flying balloons to dump rubbish hundreds of times the amount of South Korean leaflets found in the North.South Korea’s military said on Sunday that more than 700 balloons were found in various parts of the country, plus another nearly 260 balloons found days earlier.Tied to the balloons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, was manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl. No dangerous substances were said to be included.Despite the Souths claims that only about 1,000 balloons were launched, North Koreas vice defense minister said 3,500 balloons were launched carrying 15 tons of waste.NORTH KOREA ISSUES NUCLEAR WARNING SIGNAL TO US, SOUTH KOREAChang Ho-jin, South Korea’s national security director, said Sunday that the government decided to take unbearable measures against North Korea in retaliation for balloon launches, alleged jamming of GPS navigational signals in South Korea and simulation of nuclear strikes against the South.Experts say North Korea’s balloon campaign, reportedly the first of its kind in seven years, is meant to stoke an internal divide in South Korea over its conservative government’s tough policy on the North.Animosity between the Koreas is at its worst level in years as the pace of both Kims weapons demonstrations and South Korea’s combined military exercises with the U.S. and Japan have intensified since 2022.The failed satellite launch was a setback to Kim’s plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 after North Korea’s first military reconnaissance satellite was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed attempts.JUSTICE DEPT MAKES ARRESTS IN NORTH KOREA IDENTITY THEFT SCHEME INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF IT WORKERSNorth Korea has maintained that it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles.Given the fact that the security environment for our state is undergoing drastic changes owing to U.S. military maneuvers and provocations of all sorts, possessing military reconnaissance satellites presents itself as a prerequisite for our state to bolster up its self-defensive deterrent and safeguard its sovereignty and security from potential threats, Kim said.Although we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts. It is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.North Korea hasn’t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPKim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.Kim’s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea’s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite. Putin told Russian reporters at the time that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites.The U.S. and South Korea have also accused North Korea of providing Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine.The Associated Press contributed to this report.;Right

As they explained to Fox News Digital, their religion played a huge part in helping them get through the tragedy.I dont know how people do it without God because we cant explain it other than it was like supernatural peace that didnt make sense, Alexa said. It doesnt make sense. Its beyond understanding. Because after it all happened, obviously we were devastated. It was heartbreaking. And yet we felt like God was just telling us, Hey, I am so sorry you had to go through this, but I am here for you, and Im going to make a way for you.‘SPY KIDS’ STAR ALEXA PENAVEGA ON LEAVING HOLLYWOOD FOR HAWAII, INSTILLING FAITH IN FAMILYShe continued, God didnt take our baby away. I think thats one of those things that, you know, things happen in life … just because you go through something bad, sometimes I hear people say like, I cant believe God let that happen. Im like, God didnt let that happen, but God is going to make a way for you to get through that.Just because the enemy throws fiery arrows at you doesnt mean that God isnt going to make a way. Like those arrows are still going to come at you, but hes going to provide shelter. Hes going to help you with some shields. Hes going to get you through the seasons.

And I definitely had some weak moments in there.Alexa cut in to question his word choice, telling him that those moments were not weak, and he corrected himself, saying he had some very emotional moments.He explained, I think I normally dont allow myself to go there. And because I did, it actually brought us a lot closer. And, you know, grieving is OK. Like, you know, I think as men we try and stay tough.The actor, best known for starring in the Nickelodeon series Big Time Rush and for appearing in the band of the same name, stressed that its OK to grieve, its OK to be emotional.One moment in the grieving process he said he would never forget happened when a friend and his wife called and left him a special voicemail days after the stillbirth.They sung a worship song for him.No ones done that for me, ever, Carlos admitted. And just listening to the words … somebody would sit there for five minutes and sing this song for me. And I was literally, like, weeping, and Ill never forget that moment …After taking a brief moment to collect his thoughts, he said, Its hard to love people. Sometimes its hard to love God. I guess its like, why, why, why? But when can you just let go and just sit there and surrender and let the Holy Spirit take over and just let it … that moment for me will always, always be there forever.

And this movie definitely had its challenges. You know, we were filming in Kentucky … it was kind of just out of nowhere. Like here we are at Kentucky, at this university. We had a bunch of college students as the crew. So we were kind of showing them the ropes, and it ended up being such a fantastic experience.But it definitely had its challenges.

But you can take some steps to boost your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Here are some tactics to try.Increase credit scoreGenerally, people with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates. Steps that can help you improve your credit score over time include:Pay bills on time: Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.

Avoid opening new credit accounts: Only apply for and open credit accounts you actually need. Too many hard inquiries on your credit report in a short amount of time could lower your credit score.Choose a shorter loan termPersonal loan repayment terms can vary from one to several years. Generally, shorter terms come with lower interest rates, since the lender’s money is at risk for a shorter period of time.If your financial situation allows, applying for a shorter term could help you score a lower interest rate. Keep in mind the shorter term doesn’t just benefit the lender – by choosing a shorter repayment term, you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan.Get a cosignerYou may be familiar with the concept of a cosigner if you have student loans. If your credit isn’t good enough to qualify for the best personal loan interest rates, finding a cosigner with good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate.Just remember, if you default on the loan, your cosigner will be on the hook to repay it. And cosigning for a loan could also affect their credit score.Compare rates from different lendersBefore applying for a personal loan, it’s a good idea to shop around and compare offers from several different lenders to get the lowest rates. Online lenders typically offer the most competitive rates – and can be quicker to disburse your loan than a brick-and-mortar establishment.But don’t worry, comparing rates and terms doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process.Credible makes it easy.

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your credit score , debt-to-income ratio (DTI), down payment , loan amount and repayment term.After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an amortization schedule , which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.What determines the mortgage rate?Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:Location of the homePrice of the homeYour credit score and credit historyLoan termLoan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)Down payment amountLoan-to-value (LTV) ratioDTIOther indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:Current economic conditionsRate of inflationMarket conditionsHousing construction supply, demand, and costsConsumer spendingStock market10-year Treasury yieldsFederal Reserve policiesCurrent employment rateHow to compare mortgage ratesAlong with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:Shop around for lenders: Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees.

Consider a mortgage rate lock: A mortgage rate lock lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.A lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing. Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:15-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.29%6.29% Monthly payment: $2,579$2,579 Total interest charges: $164,186$164,186 Total loan amount: $464,18630-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.89%6.89% Monthly payment: $1,974$1,974 Total interest charges: $410,566$410,566 Total loan amount: $710,565Pros and cons of mortgagesIf you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:Predictable monthly payments: Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.

Potential rate changes: If you get an adjustable rate , the interest rate could increase.How to qualify for a mortgageRequirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:Have steady employment and income: You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company. Review any assets: Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts. Know your DTI: Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds. Check your credit score: To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment. Know the property type: During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property. Choose the loan type: Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, VA loans , USDA loans , FHA loans , and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs. Prepare for upfront and closing costs: Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.How to apply for a mortgageHere are the basic steps to apply for a mortgage, and what you can typically expect during the process:Choose a lender : Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits. Get pre-approved: Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts. Submit a formal application: Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents. Wait for the lender to process your loan: It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays. Complete the closing process: If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.How to refinance a mortgageRefinancing your mortgage lets you trade your current loan for a new one. It does not mean taking out a second loan. You will also still be responsible for making payments on the refinanced loan.You might want to refinance your mortgage if you:Want a lower interest rate or different rate typeAre looking for a shorter repayment term so you can pay off the loan soonerNeed a smaller monthly paymentWant to remove the PMI from your loanNeed to use the equity for things like home improvement or debt consolidation (cash-out refinancing)The refinancing process is similar to the process you follow for the original loan. Here are the basic steps:Choose the type of refinancing you want.Compare lenders for the best rates.Complete the application process.Wait for the lender to review your application.Provide supporting documentation (if requested).Complete the home appraisal.Proceed to closing, review the loan documents, and pay any closing costs.How to access your home’s equityIf you need to tap into your home’s equity to pay off debt, fund a renovation, or cover an emergency expense, there are two popular options to choose from: a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) . Both a home equity loan and a HELOC allow you to borrow against your home’s equity but a home equity loan comes in the form of a lump sum payment and a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.These two loan types have some other key similarities and differences in how they work:Home equity loan Home equity line of credit (HELOC) Interest rate Fixed Variable Monthly payment amount Fixed Variable Closing costs and fees Yes Yes, might be lower than other loan types Repayment period Typically 5-30 years Typically 10-20 yearsFAQWhat is a rate lock?Interest rates on mortgages fluctuate all the time, but a rate lock allows you to lock in your current rate for a set amount of time. This ensures you get the rate you want as you complete the homebuying process .What are mortgage points?Mortgage points are a type of prepaid interest that you can pay upfront — often as part of your closing costs — for a lower overall interest rate. This can lower your APR and monthly payments.What are closing costs?Closing costs are the fees you, as the buyer, need to pay before getting a loan.

Unlike other deals, like buy one, get one sales, credit cards come with long-term financial risks.Retailers offer consumers two card options – a store card only accepted at a certain retailer or family of brands and a co-branded card that can be used widely. The cards are primarily pitched to consumers at point-of-purchase rather than having to complete an application process or go to the bank.The quick sales-pitch nature of the card pitch can rope in unsuspecting consumers and prompt a trickle down effect on their financial plans.A lot of people, they dont intend to open up a new credit card today when they go to Costco or Walmart or even when they sign on to Amazon or whatever the case might be, Kuderna explained. Then they get that alert or the person at the register says, hey, would you be interested in opening a store credit card? You can get all of todays purchases half off. You know something that sounds like almost too good to be true, which usually does mean its too good to be true.GEN Z LEAN ON CREDIT MORE THAN MILLENNIALS DID AND RACKING UP MORE DEBTKuderna went on to explain the severe financial dangers of impulsively applying for retail credit cards.[The cards] might be attractive. They might rope us in. But if we cannot pay off that debt, and were stuck paying the interest or any late payment fees and so forth, Kuderna stressed.With these kind of point of purchase offers, theres not time for homework, he added. Some people just say, I didnt intend on opening a credit card, but now here I am. I opened a card and now what is that going to be in over the next two years for myself, my budget and my credit score.Opening the card gives an initial hit to an individuals credit score with a credit inquiry. Credit scores are critical to buying power and can help consumers save on payments and interest rates for big purchases like homes and vehicles.After the initial credit inquiry, high interest rates, late payment fees and even inactivity clauses can bring recurring disasters for consumers.Oftentimes these type of cards have a low credit limit, which means as you use it, your utilization ratio looks very high, which is not good. And then, if were not using the card for a period of time, they may end up just closing the card on us, which then reduces our credit limit. Again, not good for our credit score, Kuderna explained.What they may end up spending in interest on their store credit card or late payment fees or anything else could pale in comparison to that little savings that they got at one time when they opened the credit card.CREDIT CARD DEBT IS SURGING AS AVERAGE AMERICAN OWES $6,218According to data from Bankrate, interest rates for retail credit cards have hit a new record high at 28.93% as of October 2023. Kuderna warned the high rates make it difficult for shoppers to maximize the cards incentives and can lead to customers paying more in interest than they are making in savings.If you simply look at that math there, you could see how much in favor that is to the issuing company, the credit card company or the retail store. - Bryan KudernaThe interest that theyre going to charge, the possible penalties that could be involved, the fine print on the card, the inactivity clauses, if youre not using the card, there could be so many strings attached.Retail cards also often provide offers for young buyers and shoppers with poor credit to acquire a new credit card. Subprime lending, also called predatory lending, can be a great opportunity, but it is also an aspect which Kuderna says consumers should be extremely careful about.The spaving offer also acts similar to a subscription model. If a retailer can hook in a customer with a store card, it can create a returning buyer and potentially increase profits for that retailer. It also means consumers must face difficult choices when it comes to finances.Were doing all that for just this immediate gratification because of the intro offer. But again, the long-term effects here. We dont notice them immediately, but theyre there. And then, as they compound with other department stores, other online retailers, thats where people can really get in a mess without having intended to ever be there, Kuderna explained.While there are severe pitfalls to opening a retail card, Kuderna outlined that the credit cards could be a win-win, but you really need to do some homework on that.For those looking to open a store card, Kuderna urged consumers to evaluate the kind of card they applied for and whether the particular retailer is a place one shops frequently. In addition, consumers who do apply for a card should practice paying off balances immediately.Other tips include viewing the retail card like any conventional credit card, practicing good budgeting and remembering not to take on more debt than you are capable of paying off.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE;Right

288;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/tech/7-things-google-just-announced-that-are-worth-keeping-close-eye-on;7 things Google just announced that are worth keeping a close eye on;Googles flagship developer conference called I/O just wrapped up with interesting leaps in how the Big Tech giant is planning to change the world.Here are the seven biggest things we learned from Google at I/O 2024.Googles injecting AI into nearly every aspect of its products and servicesGoogles I/O event was largely an opportunity for it to make its case to developers — and, to a lesser extent, consumers — as to why its artificial intelligence is ahead of rivals Microsoft and OpenAI. Heres a rundown of the seven highlights to keep an eye on. Googles AI, named Gemini, was featured prominently at the I/O conference and is now available to developers worldwide.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTERAccording to the conference, Gemini is now capable of pulling information from text, photos, audio, web pages and live videos from your phones camera and is able to synthesize the information it receives and answer questions you may have about it. Heres what the Gemini improvements look like in practice.1. Phone call scam detection coming to Android could compromise your privacyGoogle showed a demo for its phone call scam detection feature, which the company says will be coming to a future version of Android. How it works is revolutionary and concerning. The feature will scan voice calls as they occur in real time, and it’s already drawing enormous privacy concerns. It would be like allowing your phone calls to be tapped and monitored by Big Tech instead of Big Brother.However, Google says, This protection all happens on device, so your conversation stays private to you. This means that you will have the choice to turn this feature on, and if you have it on, your conversation doesnt leave your device since the AI protection works directly on your device, so its impossible for Google or anyone else to hear it.Apple had planned a similar feature on iOS back in 2021 but abandoned it after backlash from privacy advocates. Google is under similar pressure, with privacy advocates worried that the company notorious for harvesting and profiting from personal data might soon misuse AI voice scanning technology.IS THE FTC CALLING YOU? PROBABLY NOT. HERES HOW TO AVOID A NEW PHONE SCAM TARGETING YOU2. ‘Ask Photos’ will let AI help you find out about specific things in photosGoogle unveiled a new feature called Ask Photos, in which users can ask Gemini to search for their photos and deliver exact results. One example showcased was the use of Gemini to locate images of your car in your photo album by telling it your license plate number.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS.

An AI button is coming to many of Google’s most popular productivity toolsStarting immediately, Google has added a button to toggle Gemini AI in the side panel of several of its Google Suite apps, including Gmail, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides. Similar to Microsofts Co-Pilot AI function, the Gemini button can help answer questions, craft emails and provide summaries of documents and email threads.HOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM GMAIL SIGNATURE4. AI tool called ‘Veo’ makes video from textWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?On a more experimental note, Google also unveiled its VideoFX feature, a generative video model based on Googles DeepMind video generator, Veo. VideoFX can create Full HD (1080p) videos from text prompts, and we also saw improvements made to ImageFX, Googles high-resolution AI image generator.For musicians, Google also showed their new DJ Mode in MusicFX, an AI music generator that can be used to create loops and samples from prompts.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS. CLICK TO GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER5. AI summaries will replace search resultsGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERETheres been a lot of press lately regarding how difficult searching for things on Google has become. Constant changes to search engine optimization as well as a new wave of bots and AI-created content has disrupted the once monolithic search engine. However, Google showed off its new AI-organized search, which promises more readable search results.Google also showed off how it is using AI to create overviews, which are short summaries to help you answer questions posed in the search box. These summaries will appear at the top of the search results page, so you dont even need to visit another website to get answers you may be looking for.6. Google TV gets the AI treatmentGoogle managed to work its Gemini AI into its Google TV smart TV operating system, allowing it to generate descriptions for movies and TV shows. When you are viewing content that is missing a description, Gemini will fill it in automatically. Gemini on Google TV will also now translate descriptions into the viewers native language, making it easier to find international shows and movies to watch.7. AI for educational purposesHOW TO DELETE EVERYTHING FROM YOUR GOOGLE SEARCHESGoogle also unveiled LearnLM, a new generative AI model that is designed for education. It comes as a collaboration between Googles DeepMind AI research division and Googles Research lab. LearnLM is designed as a chatbot that looks to tutor students on a range of subjects, from mathematics to English grammar.EXPERT TIPS, LEGIT REVIEWS. GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTERKurts key takeawaysIf you missed Google I/O 2024, here’s the scoop: Google’s AI, Gemini, stole the show with its ability to integrate information from various media and answer your queries on the fly. Noteworthy features include a call scam detection for Android, a photo search tool that can find your car using your license plate number and the integration of Gemini into Google’s Workspace suite for smarter document handling.Plus, Google’s new AI-powered search promises more readable results, and Google TV now boasts AI-generated content descriptions.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and a slew of holdovers. Flipping the script from their Memorial weekend openings, the animated orange cat crept ahead of the wasteland warrior in their second outing. The Garfield Movie earned a chart-topping $14 million in ticket sales while Furiosa settled into third place in a close race with IF, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Both IF and Furiosa are estimated to have earned $10.8 million, with IF getting the slight edge.Garfield fell only 42% in its second weekend in North America. It also topped the global box office adding $27 million from international territories, bringing its running worldwide to $152.2 million. The animated pic featuring the voice of Chris Pratt will essentially have the market to itself until Inside Out 2 arrives on June 14.AMERICAN CULTURE QUIZ: TEST YOUR COMMAND OF HOLLYWOODS HOTTEST SOUNDTRACKS, HIGH COST OF FREEDOM AND MOREFuriosa, meanwhile, fell 59% from its first weekend, adding just under $10.8 million from 3,864 locations in the U.S. and Canada. That puts its running domestic total at $49.7 million and its global sum at $114.4 million against a $168 million production budget.There were several new releases that opened on over 1,000 screens this weekend: Sony/Crunchyroll’s anime Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle, IFC’s horror In a Violent Nature, Roadside Attractions’ Diane Keaton-Alfre Woodard-Kathy Bates comedy Summer Camp, And Bleecker Street’s father-son drama Ezra. None managed to crack the top five, however.Disney also released the well-reviewed  Young Woman and the Sea, starring Daisy Ridley as the first woman to swim the English Channel, but did not report its ticket sales. Likewise, Richard Linklaters  Hit Man  is currently playing in select theaters around the country before it comes to streaming next week, but Netflix does not release box office numbers.Second place went to Paramount’s  IF, with $10.8 million in its third weekend. John Krasinski’s imaginary friends fantasy starring Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming has now made over $80.4 million domestically and $138 million worldwide. Disney/20th Century Studios’  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes  landed in fourth place in its fourth weekend with $8.8 million. It has now made $140 million domestically and $337.1 million globally.And the Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt action-comedy  The Fall Guy,  which is currently available to purchase at home, rounded out the top five with $4.2 million, bringing its domestic total to $80.3 million. Globally, the Universal release has made $157.9 million.Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle, based on the Japanese high school volleyball series, made an estimated $3.5 million from 1,119 locations. The slasher In a Violent Nature opened to $2.2 million from 1,426 locations (a massive release for IFC Films and Shudder). And, Ezra, about a stand-up comedian (Bobby Cannavale) and his autistic son, earned $1.2 million from 1,320 screens.The 2024 box office is struggling compared to both last year (down 23.9%) and pre-pandemic standards (down 42.2% from 2019 and 46.4% from 2018), according to data from Comscore. On this weekend last year, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse opened to $120.7 million while The Little Mermaid was still pulling in over $41.4 million in its second weekend. This year has yet to have any film open to over $100 million domestically.While Barbie and Oppenheimer had yet to storm theaters at this point last year, there had been several substantial hits including The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.36 billion global total), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($845.5 million) and Fast X ($704.7 million).It should come as no surprise given the nature of this year’s trajectory that we are running this far behind, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.

There are so many people who deserve to have this kind of life who don’t, but I think I’m comfortable with not deserving it and doing it anyway.

He told Deadline in 2018 one of the biggest regrets of my career and his life.Thurman told Entertainment Weekly that made it seem that their tensions had healed, saying, I understand him and if he wrote a great part and we were both in the right place about it, that would be something else.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

The median asking price for a typical home on the market also fell by about $3,000 to $417,000, the first time that prices had decelerated in six months.On top of that, the number of days active listings have been on the market started to rise in May for the first time in eight months, hitting a median of 46 days.MORTGAGE CALCULATOR: SEE HOW MUCH HIGHER RATES COULD COST YOUTogether, the metrics suggest that sale-price growth could soften in the coming months as persistently high mortgage rates turn off homebuyers, the report said.While buyers received a modicum of relief on housing costs at the end of May – monthly housing payments dropped to a six-week low thanks to a modest decline in mortgage rates – many Americans are still paying a record-high amount to buy a house.The median home sale price hit $390,613, according to the report, the highest level on record and a 4.3% increase from the same time last year.There are a number of driving forces behind the affordability crisis.WHY CANT YOU FIND A HOME FOR SALE?Years of underbuilding fueled a shortage of homes in the country, a problem that was later exacerbated by the rapid rise in mortgage rates and expensive construction materials.Higher mortgage rates over the past three years have also created a golden handcuff effect in the housing market. Sellers who locked in a record-low mortgage rate of 3% or less during the pandemic began have been reluctant to sell, limiting supply further and leaving few options for eager would-be buyers.Economists predict that mortgage rates will remain elevated for most of 2024 and that they will only begin to fall once the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates. Even then, rates are unlikely to return to the lows seen during the pandemic, with investors predicting just one or two rate reductions this year.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year loan rose slightly to 7.04%.

It explores the power of self-love and features self-reflection for the readers to better understand their hopes and dreams.In the book, the 70-year-old looked back at her husband Frank Gifford’s extramarital affair. The Emmy Award-winning TV host told Fox News Digital that her faith in God taught her the power of forgiveness after facing a painful betrayal.KATHIE LEE GIFFORD SAYS HOWARD STERN ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS AFTER FEUD: GOD CAN TOUCH ANYBODYS HEARTFirst of all, I loved Frank, Gifford told Fox News Digital. I was pissed at him, believe me. And furious that he would take something as precious as our marriage into a hotel room with somebody. It was so unlike him. And he put his whole family at risk because of it. But I also knew that we had a family that we loved.Gifford shared that when you hurt, you pray. And it was love, she said, that gave her the courage to forgive.I did it to save our marriage because I loved Frank, she explained. I was not going to break up our family. Nope… A man said to me once, ‘Kathie, if you can’t forgive your husband, forgive your children’s father.’ I said, ‘Well, that guy’s wonderful. That guy is a beautiful human being.’ He said, ‘Then forgive that guy.’ It worked.I was never the same though, Gifford admitted. People take sex so casually, and it pretty much did me in for a long time. But I just went back to work, thanked everybody for their prayers and tried to avoid any newspapers for a long, long time.According to the book, Frank met a woman at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue in New York City on May 1, 1997. Gifford wrote that for years after the affair, she avoided driving down Park Avenue to avoid being triggered by hurtful emotions. With the help of a counselor, Gifford was able to forgive her husband.My whole faith is built on the foundation of forgiveness: Jesus died for me for the forgiveness of my sins, Gifford wrote. We cannot withhold from others what He has freely given to us.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERIn the book, Gifford described how she struggled to see her husband the same way after the affair, noting he wasn’t my hero anymore. Still, she did not have any regrets about forgiving him.My children’s father was a wonderful, loving, gentle, compassionate, generous, and sweet man, she wrote. He was easy to forgive because I knew his heart.I prayed an almost impossible prayer, she wrote. ’Lord, please give me a deeper desire for Frank than I have ever had for him, even more than at the beginning.’ This was an epic request. I was crazy in love with Frank then, and grateful to finally have the kind of exciting, thrilling, ecstatic love I’d only known about from books or movies. To my surprise, God answered my prayer and gave me a desire for Frank, unlike anything we had ever experienced. Every time we made love, it was truly healing for me.The laughter returned, and our children grew up to be the most extraordinary two human beings I’ve ever known, Gifford continued. By the time they learned the truth of what had happened, they knew an even deeper truth: their parents loved them and each other enough to trust in God’s healing.Our lives can take some unexpected twists and turns. Some come as the result of our choices, other times it’s because of someone else’s. No matter how hard things might become, it’s never too late to bring beauty from the ashes. If you find yourself in such a place as I did – in the midst of a season of great difficulty – take a deep breath, prayerfully face the truth, find a Christian counselor to help you figure out your next steps, and trust God to lead you through.When the news of Frank’s infidelity became public, it was their pal, Rev. Billy Graham, who called.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSI watched as Billy’s words of mercy and grace washed over [Frank], Gifford wrote. I could see his eyes well up with tears as he heard Billy’s magnificent voice tell him, ‘Remember, Frank, there is no condemnation in Christ. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.’ ‘Thank you, Billy,’ was all Frank could say… Thank you, Billy Graham. Thank you. Forever.Gifford told Fox News Digital that what she remembers most about Graham is his kindness to me. The Evangelist died in 2018 at age 99.I met him when I was in my 20s, said Gifford. He remained one of my best friends my whole life. He said something very, very important early on. He said, ‘Kathie, you’re going to have a big career in the entertainment industry. But I just want to let you know that I have nothing I regret in life except for getting involved a few times with politics. I would never do that again. You instantly lose half your audience. If I were you, I would keep my message the same for the rest of your life and your career. Be the same person on camera, off camera, wherever you are. Just tell people that Jesus loves them.’That’s what I’ve done, said Gifford. He gave me the boldness to say it. A lot of people will whisper to me, ‘I’m a believer, too.’ I go, ‘Why are you whispering?’ A lot of people are afraid to even be open about their faith, open about their politics, open about who they are… [But] I have to be bold for Him. I have to be.While Gifford never got over Frank’s infidelity, their love endured. The beloved patriarch passed away in 2015 at age 84.It’s like when you have a scar, she told Fox News Digital. Maybe the wound’s not there anymore, but the remembrance of it is. I think marriage is a sacred, sacred relationship, and I was never the same. No, I never was.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPeople come up to me a lot… They’ll say, ‘I just want you to know that because you stayed in your marriage, I stayed in mine.

Follow these steps to prevent parasitic infection, CDC says;Eating undercooked meat from wild game animals can cause a rare illness known as trichinellosis, health officials have warned.Six cases of the parasitic disease were reported by multiple family members from Arizona, Minnesota and South Dakota.The family members shared a meal that included undercooked meat from a black bear, as reported in the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.KITCHEN DISASTERS INCLUDING STOVETOP FIRES AND SMELLY MICROWAVES: WHAT TO DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONGIt is critically important to remember to properly cook any raw meat, as inadequately undercooked meat has a potential for both trichinosis and other infectious illnesses , Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital on Long Island, New York, told Fox News Digital.Meat containing Trichinella worms may also cross-contaminate other food items , such as vegetables, that are cooked alongside it, the CDC warned.People who consume meat from wild game animals should be aware that adequate cooking is the only reliable way to kill the parasites that cause trichinellosis, which can be resistant to freezing, Shama Cash-Goldwasser, epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, told Fox News Digital.Experts shared a summary of the cases reported so far — plus, tips for preventing trichinellosis.How did the infection from bear meat happen?In early July 2022, a 29-year-old man, whose name was not shared, started to feel ill a few days after sharing a meal during a family reunion in South Dakota.HIGH LEVELS OF RESISTANT BACTERIA FOUND IN UNCOOKED MEATS AND RAW DOG FOOD: ‘RED FLAG’He was hospitalized after returning to Minnesota, complaining of fever, severe muscle aches and swelling around the eyes. Blood tests revealed high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that can indicate a worm infection .The man’s most recent meal had included kabobs made from the meat of a black bear, the report stated.The black bear was originally harvested by one of the family members in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, in May 2022 — then frozen in a home freezer for 45 days at an unknown temperature.The bear meat was then thawed, grilled with vegetables and served inadvertently rare, the report said.The man was treated with albendazole, an anti-parasitic medication . An antibody blood test confirmed he had trichinellosis.The CDC launched an investigation, finding that six people from the gathering — with their ages ranging from 12 to 62 — had symptoms consistent with trichinellosis.Adequate cooking is the only reliable way to kill the parasites that cause trichinellosis.Among the six people, four had consumed both the bear meat and vegetables, but two only ate the vegetables. Three were hospitalized , but all recovered.MEAT CONTAMINATED WITH E. COLI COULD CAUSE HALF A MILLION URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS EACH YEAR, STUDY FINDSThe CDC found live worms in the remaining bear meat.Approximately 1% to 24% of black bears in Canada and Alaska are infected with trichinellosis, per the report.What is trichinellosis?Trichinellosis is the disease caused by a parasitic worm called Trichinella, Scott Roberts, M.D., associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, told Fox News Digital.It is very rare in humans and associated with eating raw and undercooked meats, particularly pork and wild game.RAW DIET FOR DOGS IS TAKING OVER TIKTOK, BUT WHAT DOES YOUR VETERINARIAN THINK OF THE LATEST TREND?Some examples of wild game that may cause disease include wild boar, wildcat, fox, wolf, seal or walrus — but people can also get infected from homemade jerky and sausage, according to the CDC.There are approximately 10,000 cases worldwide every year, but only about 15 cases in the U.S. annually.The disease historically has been linked to eating uncooked pork, but a better understanding of proper food preparation has reduced those occurrences, Glatt noted.Current regulations around raising commercially farmed pigs have also helped to lower the risk of trichinellosis in the U.S., the CDC noted.Although infection is rare, it is possible after eating even a small amount of raw or undercooked meat, the agency warned.Symptoms of diseaseThe severity of symptoms depends on how much of the parasite is ingested, Roberts told Fox News Digital.After the contaminated meat is consumed, the stomach produces acid that causes larvae to be released, the CDC stated.These larvae then invade the small intestine, which may cause gastrointestinal symptoms .Wild game meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure safe consumption.After one week, the larvae travel in the bloodstream, sometimes making their way into the muscle — which can cause muscle pain, according to the CDC.Symptoms can range from none at all, to GI issues (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and muscle/joint pain, Roberts said.One hallmark symptom is swelling of the face, especially around the eyes, per the CDC.Occasionally, the worms may also travel to the heart, lungs or brain, which can lead to problems with coordination, cardiovascular issues or breathing issues.Most cases will not require treatment, but antiparasitic therapy can be given if symptoms are severe, Roberts said.Prevention is keyTo prevent trichinellosis, Cash-Goldwasser of the CDC recommends cooking wild game meat to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) and verifying the temperature with a meat thermometer.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Safe handling of raw meat, including separation of raw or undercooked meat and its juices from other foods, is also recommended to prevent cross-contamination, she told Fox News Digital.The agency also advises against sampling meat until it has been confirmed to be fully cooked — and recommends freezing pork less than six inches thick for 20 days at 5 degrees Fahrenheit.Some wild game animals are freeze-resistant, which means freezing may not effectively kill all worms.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSalting, drying, smoking or microwaving meat also does not effectively kill worms, per the CDC.People should always remember to wash their hands with soap and warm water before and after handling raw meat — and to clean meat grinders and all other kitchen items thoroughly after each use, the agency advised.;Right

Either that, or inside wraps.When you get creative and curious like that — in any way, shape or form, its still a serving of salad that youre taking in, as opposed to not having a salad.Things are constantly evolving, constantly moving.

The current record is June 6, which was set in 2010.Sacramento in California will also likely get above 100 degrees this week, with a forecast high temperature on Tuesday of 102 degrees, followed by 104 degrees on Wednesday.These temperatures constitute readings that will be 10-20 degrees above average for much of inland California and the Desert Southwest.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPHeat alerts issued for parts of 6 states in WestWith the potentially dangerous heat wave expected to build, the National Weather Service has placed more than 25 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and Texas under a heat alert.Parts of Northern and Central California and southern Nevada, including Las Vegas, are under Excessive Heat Warnings, while places such as Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona are under an Excessive Heat Watch.Computer forecast models show the worst of the heat wave will happen on Wednesday and Thursday but could linger into Friday and the upcoming weekend.HOW THE WEATHER YOU’RE ACCUSTOMED TO AFFECTS NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HEAT WARNINGS, ADVISORIESNational Weather Service meteorologists warn of heat-related illnesses for those who are not drinking plenty of fluids and do not have access to air conditioning.Additionally, overnight lows will not drop into a comfortable range, which will impose an additional burden on people and pets hoping to cool off after sunset.In many of the areas where daily records could be tied or broken, the National Weather Service’s HeatRisk map has labeled communities at a Level 3 or 4 out of 4 for impacts.The HeatRisk threat level takes into consideration the unusual nature of the heat, the duration of the extreme temperatures and potential health impacts.WHEN SECONDS MATTER: CHILDREN EXPERIENCE HEATSTROKE SYMPTOMS WITHIN MINUTES OF BEING IN A HOT CARAt a code red (Level 3) stage, heat affects anyone who is not adequately hydrated or those without access to cooling.

The SPC said the hail appeared to be as long as a 16 oz Monster Nitro energy drink can.And while that report is jaw-dropping, it still doesn’t break the record for the largest hailstone in Texas history.That honor belongs to hail that measured 6.4 inches in diameter that fell in April 2021 in Hondo, Texas, west of San Antonio.There were other reports of large hail in other communities, including a report of 4.5-inch hail and 3-inch hail in Brisco County.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHERPossible tornado in Texas injuries US Border Patrol agentWhile many communities were experiencing giant hail from the storms over the weekend, others were clearing damage and debris after likely tornadoes, including one that injured a U.S. Border Patrol agent near the U.S.-Mexico border.According to Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland, emergency crews responded to the town of Sanderson after a likely tornado there on Sunday.In a Facebook post, Cleveland said a U.S. Border Patrol agent was injured when his house took a direct hit from the storm.He said everyone has been accounted for, and all roads have been cleared of debris.;Right

The previous record of 0.48 inches was set on June 2, 2001.Seattle averages about 1.45 inches of rain for the entire month of June.And farther south, more record rainfall totals were recorded.Portland picked up 0.69 inches of rain on Sunday, breaking its old record for that date of 0.67 inches on June 2, 2010.Other communities in Oregon, like Astoria and McMinnville, also saw record rainfall amounts on Sunday.Big shift to hot and dry pattern days later?But the winter throwback could take a radical shift into summer by the end of this week in the Northwest.LIFE-THREATENING TRIPLE-DIGIT HEAT ACROSS WEST COULD THREATEN LAS VEGAS EARLIEST 110-DEGREE DAY ON RECORDSome computer forecast models are suggesting a rapid change in the weather pattern, bringing in the potential for much hotter weather as a strong ridge of high pressure builds into the region.;Right

It aims to put a person on the moon before 2030.A Chinese spacecraft landed on the far side of the moon on Sunday to collect soil and rock samples that could provide insights into differences between the less-explored region and the better-known near side.The landing module touched down at 6:23 a.m. Beijing time in a huge crater known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the China National Space Administration said.The mission is the sixth in the Chang’e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e 5, which did so from the near side in 2020.LAS VEGAS ALIENS TRY TO STAVE OFF PESKY HUMANS, EXPERT SAYS: WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there.The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again — for the first time in more than 50 years — though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.U.S. efforts to use private-sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned launch of Boeings first astronaut flight Saturday.Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon.In China’s current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 4.4 pounds of surface and underground material over about two days.An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of China’s Inner Mongolia region about June 25.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMissions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications.

However, he maintains that the trial was ‘rigged’ against him and vows to remain in the presidential race. While it’s too early to tell the polling impact of the convictions, there is some anecdotal evidence that some voters have been energized by the decision. Meanwhile, President Biden is looking to roll out executive action to address the border crisis on Tuesday.

Rufo says this has been a problem 20 years in the making as Columbia has hired radicals and have been accepting money from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf non-democratic states. Rufo sees a silver lining after all the pro-Hamas anti-Semitic protests on college campuses. Rufo points to recent polls showing the protestors have around a 6% favorability rating in the United States and it is now up to political leaders in the country to take advantage of this opportunity to cut public funding to private institutions that allow these protests on their campuses. Rufo also spoke about Donald Trump telling Fox & Friends Weekend he would like to get rid of the Department of Education. When asked if that is possible, Rufo said after decades of promises by republicans to do that, “Trump is one of the only people who is bold enough, who is courageous enough, who is, frankly, crazy enough to do something like that and actually make it a reality.”;Right

That as the power shifts from one party to another, if this is the new norm, if this is what we do in America now, which President Biden and the Democratic leaders saying, this is what we do, then this will be what occurs not only to prominent presidential candidates or a former president in this case, but to everyday Americans. How can we just as everyday Americans, feel safe in exercising something that is so fundamental to who we are as Americans in this country, in having the freedom to criticize our own government and having the freedom to say, no, Mr. President, you’re wrong because of X, Y, and Z. I disagree with you. I think your policies are bad for our country. This is unique to our freedoms that we have in this country, that a lot of other people in other countries, frankly, don’t have. And the reason they don’t have it is because of actions from people in power, like we just saw yesterday. That was a powerful message to everyone that says, hey, if you go against us, if you go against the Democrat elite, you may be next. You may be on the receiving end of this weaponization of our justice system and law enforcement. That to me, is the real travesty of what happened yesterday and what’s continuing to happen. Yesterday was just one further step in that direction, and why I feel so strongly that this must be a unifying moment. This isn’t about a Republican victory over Democrats, or, in the Democrats minds, a Democrat victory over Republicans. This has got to be a unifying moment for us as Americans, to truly recognize the seriousness of this moment in our country, because it will go down in the history books as a travesty for our country, and how we have to take individual responsibility as American citizens to right this wrong by punishing those who are abusing their power at the ballot box on November 5th and sending them home, getting them out of office.”Jimmy and Tulsi also talk about the importance of keeping the Republican Party unified in this moment.

You get 34 misdemeanors, they bump to a felony in service to a second crime. Now, this is what a lot of media is getting wrong. That second crime is named. And it is New York state election law. It is an obscure statute of the New York state election law, which very clearly was not contemplated to be used in this way. But, you know, brig drags it out of mothballs. I don’t know that it’s ever been used. And he uses it. Here’s the subtlety. Under that second law, it has to be done by, quote unquote, unlawful means. That’s where the action is right there. Because the unlawful means that are listed is that laundry list of three other statutes. So you have the first statute, the misdemeanor, falsification of business records, the 34 of them, lean on the second statute, which is the election law, which states that you have to impede an election by unlawful means. What are your local means? Here’s a list of three. And you can use any of these three, jurors, to say it’s an unlawful means. Now what’s subtlety? You’re not charging those three. They are just the quote unquote unlawful means. So that’s why he’s getting kind of away with it. Even though it is constitutional law that every element of a crime has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. That’s not in the jury result here. And that’s why it is so vulnerable to reversal. There’s no way this is going to hold up.”Jimmy and Paul also discuss the possibility of Judge Juan Merchan giving Trump a jail sentence.

This is a guy who is in the front position and the likely person who will be the next president of the United States. It is preposterous that we would sit him for six weeks in a courthouse for this sham of a case. You better have something rock solid and airtight if you are going to drag a former and likely future president into a courtroom in downtown Manhattan. And this whole thing has been such a show trial, it’s been such a clown show in and of itself. But yeah, I’m sure they’re probably regretting it to some extent, because everything they’ve tried to do to Donald Trump backfires and blows up in their face. They first started with the very first indictment, and they thought, well, that’ll be all it takes to take down Donald Trump. Then they had another indictment and they said, let’s get Fani Willis in Fulton County involved. Get her to put out a mug shot, that’ll seal the deal. Nobody will want to vote for this guy. And his poll numbers shot up and people said, wait a minute, something’s going on here. I better pay attention. And then they’ve had to see day in and day out for six weeks, Donald Trump sit through this crazy mess of a trial over absolutely nothing. There’s nothing that ties him to anything illegal. And it is wild and crazy. And it is so un-American to see. So yeah, they’re probably regretting this to some extent, and I hope their ultimate regret comes on the evening of November 5th of this year, when they ultimately realize that they have actually helped elect Donald Trump as the next president.”Jimmy and Lara also share their thoughts on actor Robert De Niro’s recent rant about Trump outside the courthouse in Manhattan.

Chris Sununu: Voters Not Losing Sleep Over The Trump Trial, They Are Worried About Paying Bills & Inflation;New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu spoke to Brian Kilmeade about the left being disappointed that he is supporting Donald Trump after Niki Haley dropped out of the race. Sununu pointed to his comments from the very beginning that he would support the republican nominee and wants a republican administration because liberals are destroying the country. Sununu loved hearing Katie Couric saying Trump is surprisingly gaining momentum despite being on trial. Sununu believes Couric and the left got exactly what they wanted by demonizing Trump by going after him every day. Sununu thinks there is no doubt they created the situation with Trump gaining momentum. Sununu says the reason they can’t understand this is that would mean they have to accept responsibility. According to Sununu, the American people are tired of different rules based on the political party or political agenda. Sununu said voters are not losing sleep over the trial and are more worried about everyday issues such as paying bills, feeding their families, inflation, and the border. Sununu says these are reasons why Trump is resonating in places like New Hampshire, where no Republican president has won since 2000 and how the polls are showing Trump can win in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia. Sununu also spoke about the Northern border breaking records with illegal crossings and how more people on the terror watch list are crossing the Northern border from Canada.;Right

And the very first miracle Jesus performs is at a wedding, the weddingat Cana. It is now officially wedding season, in the month of June moreweddings will take place than at any other time of the year. But how do youensure that a beautiful wedding with all the pomp and pageantry creates astrong marriage, where husband and wife move forward joyfully in whole-lifeoneness? Enter Fr. Nicholas Louh and Dr. Roxanne Louh. Fr. Nick is a GreekOrthodox Priest who’s presided over the nuptials of scores of couples.

If we really want to be honest, the world isnt talking about the WNBA, its talking about Caitlin Clark who just happens to play in the league.READ: Caitlin Clark Shatters WNBA Ratings Records, Proves To Be Leagues Biggest StarPlenty of folks at ESPN understand this, the offices in Bristol arent entirely filled with people who lack common sense, but Pat McAfee seems to be the only one at the four-letter network willing to discuss the very obvious situation.During Mondays edition of his show, McAfee reacted to Chennedy Carter of the Chicago Sky putting Clark on the floor with a cheapshot over the weekend. The hard foul added more fuel to the ridiculous conversation about Clark needing to ‘earn her stripes’ as a rookie and how its fine for non-rookies in the league to feel frustrated that shes already looked at as the face of the WNBA less than a half-season into her professional career.McAfee isnt having it. He and his co-hosts played a game of ‘Which WNBA Rookie’ to perfectly rip apart the theory that Clark isnt the driving force behind the interest in the league. Nothing McAfee said was opinion, either, he brought facts to the discussion.He closed out the segment by calling out those in the media pushing the narrative that the entire 2024 rookie class is driving the conversation in the league, when in reality it all falls on the shoulders of Clark.I would like the media people that continue to say ‘this rookie class, this rookie class, this rookie class, no, lets just call it for what it is. Theres one white bit-h for the Indiana team who is a superstar, McAfee said.We have to hear people say that ‘we all like her because she’s white or ‘she’s only popular because the rest of the rookie class is doing well, well thats a bunch of bullsh-t, he continued.This entire narrative were seeing play out with Clark that is not-so-subtly focused on the color of her skin was incredibly predictable, but seeing it already hit this level just 11 games into her career is a bit surprising.;Right

I hope you’re happy, Anthony Edwards, now Cam’ron is pissed. The Purple Haze rapper freestyles over Black Rob’s iconic Whoa beat to begin his It Is What It Is Podcast. He is joined by fellow Harlem rapper Ma$e Monday morning, and its available on YouTube. Cam’ron takes issue with the new Adidas commercial promoting Edwards’ first signature, the AE 1.In the ad, a friend chilling on a bench reads the receipts … of all the hate to Edwards while he is shooting jumpers. Edwards’ friend only specifically names Cam’ron and former NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony. Ant-Man responds with F***, buddy to Cam’ron’s opinion presumably given on his podcast, To me, he’s an All-Star but not a superstar, yet.Now, it probably isn’t the best time to be a Grammar Nazi, but the comma behind F*** is doing a little work here. Edwards could perhaps argue the comma makes this a two-part statement. First, Ant-Man is angry that Cam’ron criticizes him and, second, Edwards calls him a buddy. However, the buddy can be taken condescendingly. Well, Cam’ron didn’t read it that way.Donning mad jewelry, including his trademark Diplomat iced-out piece, a Luka Dončić Dallas Mavericks jersey, and, eventually, a bucket hat, Cam’ron rips Edwards. The first two-plus minutes of the freestyle is Camron warming up with bars about his legacy, reputation, recent beef with Melyssa Ford, etc. before addressing the Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star with But, f*** wrong with Ant-Man?He continues with Gave him his props. Homie got love for me. New commercial, yall aint got love for me? He shot a jump and said ‘F***, buddy’. The receipt reader looking like ‘You’re f***ed buddy. And, trust buddy, I dont want to judge, buddy. Buddy sitting there glazing at you like ‘I love buddy’. Granted, Camrons Ant-Man squashing isnt as bad as Kendrick drawing and quartering Drake in their recent beef, but its scathing.Camron keeps it real with Anthony Edwards about AdidasAfter calling Edwards the B-ball version of Kanye, the Diplomat frontman rhymes Stop it, dude. Yall just stopping through. He [Edwards] do something yall dont like, youll drop him too. Camron ends by reminding Edwards about the famous injuries of Adidas-sponsored dudes. F***ing careers up: T-Mac, Derrick Rose, RGIII, John Wall, let ‘em know … You know Kevin Ware? Google what was on his toes. Whoa.This part of Camrons diss track hit me the hardest. One of the unwritten laws of hooping is that you Dont wear Adidas. Adidas has taken some big swings and misses with its basketball products while never really eating into Nikes market share. Honestly, if you have anything on your feet besides Nike basketball sneakers, you run the risk of destroying your legs.Look at the athletes whose careers were cut short and coincidentally wearing Adidas. Ware had one of the most gruesome injuries in basketball history, suffering a compound fracture of his leg during the 2013 Elite Eight. Tracy McGrady battled through knee and ankle injuries for years. Fellow OutKick hoops handicapper, David Troy, and I joked about what Adidas did to D-Roses career.This Camron-Anthony Edwards beef is currently the most interesting thing in the NBA, which is alarming considering the Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics 2024 NBA Finals start this week. But, thats how the NBA has been operating for years. Off-the-court drama and the player empowerment era get more attention than any game. Given the lack of American star power, that trend will continue for the 2024 NBA Finals. Hopefully, Camron drops a diss track on NBA commissioner Adam Silver._____________________________Follow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.;Right
392;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.outkick.com/sports/edmonton-florida-stanley-cup-final-american-nightmare-nhl;Edmonton-Florida Stanley Cup Final Is An American Nightmare For NHL;Were about to find out if the NHL can successfully market its best player (Connor McDavid) during its biggest event (the Stanley Cup Final) to an American audience. Because McDavid is about the only draw that the Edmonton Oilers vs. the Florida Panthers Final has for hockey fans in the United States.Sure, there are some Florida Panthers fans who started watching hockey when Florida got good a few years ago. Before I get emails from those tens of fans, just understand that the television ratings dont lie. Florida Panthers playoff games do not do well in the ratings, at least they dont unless theyre facing the New York Rangers (or the Boston Bruins, for that matter).See, the NHL really wanted the Rangers in the Stanley Cup Final. Its no secret that New York draws better than every other team in the league when it comes to television. There are other teams that draw well, too, but Florida isnt one of them. Plus, they have only one American player on their playoff roster (to be fair, though, its their best player, Matthew Tkachuk).That brings us to Edmonton. There are not a lot of Oilers fans in the United States. Canadian viewers dont count towards the television ratings that the league needs to sell its product to American networks. Thus, the NHL has a disaster on its hands in the form of two teams that people just arent going to be interested in watching.Unless, of course, the league can convince casual hockey fans to watch Connor McDavid, easily the best hockey player of this generation (possibly ever, based on talent). Its McDavids first trip to the Stanley Cup Final in his nine seasons in the NHL. This was just the second time his Oilers even reached the Western Conference Final.Major League Baseball is often criticized for not marketing its biggest stars and best players properly. The NHL has a golden opportunity to put McDavid front-and-center, and use Tkachuk as an American rival to the Canadian superstar.Can they pull it off and get the United States audience to watch? Thats what were going to find out.The Stanley Cup Final matchup between the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers is a problem for the NHL, but so is the schedule.The NHL had a great opportunity to capitalize on the NBA having a huge gap between its conference finals and the NBA Finals.The Dallas Mavericks eliminated the Minnesota Timberwolves last Thursday. The NBA Finals dont start until this Thursday. The NHL had a chance to keep its momentum going and start the Stanley Cup Final before the NBA got going and generate some buzz.But they arent doing that. Instead, the NHL is taking nearly a week off just like the NBA. Except, the NHL had two six-game conference finals, where the NBA had a sweep and a five-game series. The Stanley Cup Final doesnt begin until Saturday.Not only that, but with the days off in-between, Game 7 of the NHLs final series wouldnt happen until June 24! The latest possible date for the NBA Finals to end is June 23. Theres an argument to be made that both seasons are far too long, but thats for another day.Plus, because the NBA got its schedule out first, the NHL had to work around it. Instead of getting the best spots during the week, the NHL is starting its final series on a Saturday night in June. Its pretty fair to wonder if people have better things to do on a summer Saturday night than watch the Stanley Cup Final.They also have Game 4 scheduled for a Saturday night and Game 6 scheduled for a Friday night. Add it all up and the NHL figures to have a lower-rated Stanley Cup Final than its Eastern Conference Final. Is that me being biased as a bitter New York Rangers fan? Somewhat.But the point holds. People care about the New York Rangers and love them or hate them, they tune in to watch. Good luck getting Americans to watch the Edmonton Oilers and the Florida Panthers.;Right

Smith Admits Black WNBA Women Are Jealous Of Caitlin Clark Because Of Her Race;Stephen A. Smith admitted to what only OutKick has written for the past four months: women in the WNBA are jealous of Caitlin Clark and race is a contributing factor.There are girls – young ladies – in the WNBA who are jealous of Caitlin Clark. She is a White girl that has come into the league, Smith said while discussing Chennedy Carter shoving Clark to the floor on Saturday.She has bursted onto the scene. She hasn’t proven herself yet. It’s not even about them thinking they’re better than her because they probably know it at this particular juncture because they’ve been playing on a level she just arrived to.One would think that folks would be smart enough to recognize and appreciate that about Caitlin Clark – piggyback off of that to their benefit and praise her and support her for it while competing on the court against her.Hes right – about all of that.We hope he doesnt backtrack. Smith is known to make a good point, upset Black Twitter, and then cave.Last month, he apologized to the black community for citing polls that suggest black Americans relate to Donald Trumps feeling that the system is persecuting him.Carter could have separated Clarks shoulder. Angel Reese cheered the cheap shot. Carter doubled down on X, liking tweets encouraging her to injure Clark further. WNBA influencers like Kelsey Nelson and Monica McNutt defended Carter for the incident.The WNBA did not suspend or even fine Carter.The precedent is set.At this rate, Caitlin Clark is going to be seriously injured on the basketball court.We explained on Sunday:How women of color in the WNBA feel about Clark is a symptom. A racialized culture is the cause.History taught us long ago that when society inflames racial hatred, violence usually follows.Already, society preaches to black Americans that white people are their enemies and their oppressors. According to a recent Gallup poll, most black people believe that.White derangement syndrome is real – particularly when involved in historically black spaces, like professional basketball. And thats the reality Caitlin Clark faces.What we’re going to do is give the level of appreciation that it deserves in terms of the venom and potential hostility that exists toward this ‘golden girl’ who happens to be white and how the WNBA is promoting her, Smith concludes.Ultimately, very few people in the media have the stability and courage to defend Clark against her jealous, gratuitously aggressive black counterparts – understanding the race mob is looming.Stephen A. Smith is the most influential voice in the sports media. He has the platform to shine a bright light on the hatred stemming from Clarks arrival in the WNBA.;Right
394;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/media/brentwood-blight-supreme-court-case-allowed-governments-seize-property-behalf-developers;Brentwood blight: How a Supreme Court case allowed governments to seize property on behalf of developers;As fireworks burst in the sky on Independence Day 2018, Roxanne and Carter Maier were putting in yet another grueling 14-hour day of remodeling a former doctors office into a dance studio in Brentwood, a small suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.This is the last time were doing this, the husband and wife team told each other multiple times throughout the move to their new location. Sweat poured down their faces as they ripped industrial carpet away from the concrete floor. They invested about $100,000 and countless hours renovating the building with the hopes of eventually purchasing it.But just a few years later, the city declared a strip of businesses — including the Maiers — and small industrial buildings blighted. It moved to hand over the land to a private developer in a $436 million deal that seeks to use eminent domain to force out existing property owners and replace them with apartments, a hotel, office space, a microbrewery and stores.The developer behind the project estimated it would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years.SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF TEXAS GRANDMOTHER THROWN IN JAIL AFTER CRITICIZING CITY GOVERNMENTThe Maiers, now in their 50s and 60s, are faced with the prospect of yet another move.At this point in our life, Carter said, do we want to go through again what we did last time?Several business and property owners affected by the deal are suing, accusing the City of Brentwood of using a vague blight designation as a pretext to give their property to a private company. It’s a strategy local governments across the nation are using to skirt state eminent domain restrictions, according to their lawyers.Kelo v. New London: The SCOTUS case that changed everythingA 2005 Supreme Court ruling allowed cities like Brentwood to seize property in the name of economic development.The catalyst for the case happened around the turn of the millennium in Connecticut. After pharmaceutical giant Pfizer built a plant in New London in 1998 — with the added bonus of an 80% tax abatement — the city wanted to revitalize the surrounding area. Officials approved a development plan that required seizing homes and selling the property to developers to build new commercial and residential complexes. The city also agreed to kick in $78 million for the project.Susette Kelo and other property owners sued and were represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit civil liberties law firm now representing the Brentwood businesses. They argued New London was violating the Fifth Amendments takings clause, which prohibits the government from confiscating private property without just compensation. The property owners argued seizing their homes to sell to private companies was not a public use.But in a 5-4 opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the seizure qualified as public use because the city was following an economic development plan, not just trying to benefit a certain group of private citizens.The specter of condemnation hangs over all property, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in her dissent. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY AFTER SUPREME COURT RULES TEXAS RANCHER CAN SUE STATE OVER FLOODED LANDSWithin a year of the decision, local governments condemned or threatened eminent domain against nearly 6,000 homes, churches, businesses and other private properties, according to Institute for Justice researchers.The Supreme Court ruling also triggered a nationwide backlash, and soon, 43 state legislatures and eight state supreme courts strengthened protections for property owners, including Missouri, where lawmakers passed a bill in 2006 specifying that property cant be seized solely for economic development.But Missouri and other states included a carve-out that would prove critical. Cities could still move to seize blighted areas, defined by Missouri law as having insanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of site improvements or other factors that present economic or social liability.That broad definition can be used to condemn entire neighborhoods, even if individual homes or other properties are in spectacular condition, according to the state.Institute for Justice attorney Bob Belden, who represents the businesses in their lawsuit, said cities across the country are taking advantage of extremely elastic definitions of blight.If you know anything about deterioration, by definition, the moment something is built, it starts to deteriorate, Belden said. So one problem that we see cities exploiting is a sort of lack of concrete detail on what the blight factors are.Brentwood officials declare area blighted, immediately threaten eminent domainDeer Creek meanders through the area behind the Maiers dance studio and chiropractor office. It used to flood during heavy storms, damaging businesses on Manchester Road. So Roxanne Maier said she wasnt all that surprised when, in 2018, the city deemed the area blighted.There were several properties in that time that were blighted, she said. They were not really in the best condition, but they had flooded every once in a while, and people werent going to be putting a lot of money into a building that would flood again.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREThen in 2019, the city launched a $95 million flood mitigation project, converting around 14 areas around the troublesome creek into green space. Officials at the time hoped that getting the area out of the flood plain would kickstart future development.Its beautiful, Roxanne said of the improvements. Carter said people are already walking and jogging on new trails by the creek, and that in addition to the flood mitigation, the city installed fresh sidewalks, street lighting and repaved a large stretch of the formerly deteriorating Manchester Road.So the Maiers and other business owners were shocked when the city again deemed the area blighted and announced a plan to have Green Street, a major St. Louis development firm, replace the small storefronts with a new, mixed-use development. Property owners could either sell willingly or be forced out by eminent domain under the plan.I have to sell my property, and lucky you, you get a property that’s out of a floodplain, and the roads are done and beautiful sidewalks, one property owner said during an Aug. 15, 2022, public meeting, gesturing at representatives of Green Street sitting behind her.The citys original blight designation eventually expired, according to business owners.Then in 2023, despite investing heavily in improvements, Brentwood officials again declared 77 acres of Manchester Road blighted, a slightly smaller section than the original 2018 boundaries.When they re-blighted it after they had done all these improvements, it made no sense, said Carolyn Wilson, who started a meal-prep business with her sister in 2004. But it also made us feel extremely vulnerable and powerless.A blight study the city published in 2023 listed few specific problem properties, but noted that about 60% of buildings were 52 years old or older, meaning they likely contain hazardous materials and unsafe conditions.Photos taken between 2022 and 2023 and included in a city presentation showed wooden pallets propped up near a trash can, seemingly-unoccupied buildings, loose bricks in a wall and parking lots with cracked or crumbling pavement. The city noted that newer buildings in the area needed fresh paint or other repairs.GRANDMOTHER WINS $4 MILLION AFTER SWAT RAIDED WRONG HOME BASED ON FIND MY IPHONE APPThe study also found that the private properties in poor condition will generate less tax revenues than similarly situated properties in better condition. Therefore, the area constitutes an economic liability, the city wrote in its presentation.Its bogus, said Bob Story, who runs Feather-Craft, a fly-fishing business his father founded in 1955 and has been located on Manchester Road since 1989. This area looks exactly like every other area around here in Brentwood.Story added, Its all about the tax revenue.The city declined an interview request and would not comment on the development plans or the lawsuit.Under the law, eminent domain is legal to address a blighted area, Brentwood Mayor David Dimmit said during a July 2023 public meeting. That has always been part of the process.He argued having a master redeveloper like Green Street take over the entire area would create a cohesive, thriving area, which wouldnt be possible by simply purchasing a few properties here and there.Later that month, the Board of Aldermen approved an ordinance to redevelop around 40 acres of the area. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2025, and Green Street would need to acquire all the properties within the redevelopment boundaries, local media reported.IJs lawsuit alleges businesses in the area were never informed that their properties were considered blighted and that city officials never told the plaintiffs their properties could be seized. The suit further argues the city failed to present substantial evidence of deterioration or unsafe conditions and merely used the blight designation as a pretext to seize private property on Green Streets behalf.Representatives for Green Street did not return multiple emails and phone calls seeking comment on the project. In proposals for the development, the company estimated the project would generate more than $266 million in new revenue over the next 25 years, including nearly $42 million in taxes for local jurisdictions and $51.6 million for the Brentwood School District.But the company is also facing internal issues.Green Street owes the city of St. Louis nearly $800,000 in delinquent property taxes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in December. Contractors filed dozens of lawsuits against the company, many of which have since been resolved, claiming they hadnt been paid for their work. And last year, the company laid off a half dozen employees, blaming current levels of economic activity, the Post-Dispatch reported.Green Streets lobbyist did not answer questions about the property taxes or other problems, local outlets reported.The road ahead for business ownersThe case raises the question of whether anybody in the United States really owns their property if all it takes for the government to take it away from you is that the government can come by and think, ‘Well, I could probably use this property better,’ Belden, the Institute for Justice attorney, told Fox News Digital.And while property owners will be paid if their buildings are seized, renters like the Maiers, Story and Wilson arent entitled to much other than whats in their lease agreements and possible relocation assistance, Belden said. Wilson and her sister fear moving would make it difficult for their business to survive.Weve been in our present location for 20 years, and were well known in the area and everybody knows where we are, she said. Theyre used to coming to our current location.Belden sees echoes of the Kelo case, which he called one of the Supreme Courts most widely reviled decisions, in the Brentwood fight, as well as a cautionary tale.Crews tore down dozens of houses and bulldozed the New London neighborhood, but nearly two decades after the Supreme Court victory authorizing it, most of the land remains a barren lot.Pfizer shuttered its plant just before its tax breaks expired, scrapping 1,400 jobs and moving its operations a few miles away to another campus to cut costs. Earlier this year, crews laid the foundation for a future community center on a small portion of the land. Other parcels have recently been sold to companies hoping to build apartments and a hotel.To this day, the property where [Kelos] home used to sit is vacant, Belden said. The only thing that has occupied the property there at any point has been feral animals.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHe sees Green Streets tax debts and other problems as a harbinger of whats to come.You make on the front end all of these promises about what will come, he said.

Vasquez received endorsements from several police groups, crime victims and business owners.THIS RED STATE IS BECOMING AN ‘EXPAT’ COMMUNITY FOR FAMILIES FLEEING WESTERN LIBERAL BASTIONS[Vasquez] can begin serving victims rather than criminals, street photographer and homeschooling mom Tara Faul told Fox News Digital. Schmidts MO seemed to be just letting these people back out and letting them re-offend, and it became pretty hopeless.Schmidt, whose campaign received contributions from groups linked to liberal billionaire George Soros, took office during the height of Portland’s 2020 protests. He soon announced a policy of declining to prosecute the most common riot-related charges.But complaints of a revolving door at the jail extend beyond protesters. Officers with the Portland Police Bureau told Fox News earlier this year theyve arrested alleged drug dealers, thieves and repeat offenders, only to have them appear back on the streets within hours.Thats unfortunately the reality where we work and thats not up to us, officer David Baer said in January.The DAs office filed charges in just 47% of all cases it received in 2020. That rate has been steadily increasing since then, hitting 60% in 2022. But during the same time frame, police began sending fewer cases to Schmidt, according to data provided to Fox News last spring by the district attorney’s office.Faul and others in Portland say such policies exacerbated crime and created a feeling of lawlessness in the City of Roses.CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: THE HOMESCHOOLING MOM DOCUMENTING PORTLANDS DESTRUCTIONIt has been a war zone of drug dealing and petty crime for the past at least four years, said Charles Froelick, who has owned an art gallery near downtown Portland since 1995.Froelick remembers when the city was a destination for people around the globe. But between Oregons strict pandemic response in 2020 and the subsequent riots, he said walk-in traffic just plummeted.Clients are saying they dont want to come downtown anymore, he said. People with children saying they dont want their children to see the activity on the streets, on the sidewalks.Just this week, Faul said a man stole her childs guitar off the front porch of her home. The alleged crime happened in broad daylight, while her family was home, and was captured on their Ring camera. She hasnt filed a police report, and doesnt know if its worth the effort.It just seems like an incredible waste of time, and I think a lot of people who have things stolen from them feel the same way, she said.

He testified in favor of removing mandatory minimum sentences for felony crimes other than murder, introduced a court focused on rehabilitation and behavioral health support for individuals charged with some felonies, and championed the decriminalization of drugs in Oregon.He reversed course on the latter this year, endorsing lawmakers proposal to recriminalize hard drugs following a sharp backlash from Oregonians.Vasquez said in a statement that he is committed to ending open-air drug dealing and drug use while helping connect individuals to treatment, to rebuilding the broken relationships between the DA’s office and the community, and to ensuring that victims are the number one priority of my office.Violent crimes like homicides and shootings have waned since hitting record highs in 2022, according to PPB data, but Portlanders Fox News Digital spoke with see much room for improvement.I still think its going to take years, even with [Vasquez] winning this race, to rebuild, not only the trust, but just the actual safety downtown, said Chandler, who talks to numerous residents and public figures on his podcast NW Fresh.CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS BEYOND A TURNING POINT AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?The replacement of a progressive stalwart with a challenger who was a Republican until registering as an Independent in 2017 marks a radical change for the reliably-liberal Portland area.

Read parts one, two, three and four.COEUR DALENE, Idaho — Seth Horst used to avoid telling strangers what he did for a living. Police officer felt like a four-letter word in 2020, especially in California.Fast-forward a year and Horst stood with his family in downtown Coeur dAlene, Idaho, watching fire trucks and police cars roll through the street for the citys Independence Day celebration. The Kootenai County sheriff waved at residents from the back of a pickup truck, a revolver snug against his hip, Horst recalled. Cars, homes and businesses around town display the blue line flag year-round, and Horst said its not unusual for people to offer to buy coffee for police when they see them out in the streets.That is so powerful for the men and women in uniform up here to have that backing, said Horst, who left California Highway Patrol and started a real estate business in North Idaho. Its a pretty phenomenal place to do the job.BLUE CITYS EXODUS CONTINUES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR, BUT SLOWER: PEOPLE JUST FEEL TRAPPEDThe Gem State has become a popular moving destination for both retired and active-duty police officers, a trend Horst and Idaho Fraternal Order of Police President Bryan Lovell broadly attribute to a more positive climate.They come to Idaho where they can enjoy their career and make a difference, Lovell told Fox News Digital. They see that, in large part, our communities are supportive of law enforcement and public safety.Cities large and small across the country suffered severe staffing shortages on the heels of anti-police protests in 2020. Four years later, some departments still can’t stop the bleeding.Seattle’s police staffing is at its lowest level since the 1990s, according to a March KING 5 report. Earlier this year in California, the Alameda Police Department offered a $75,000 signing bonus — the highest in the nation — on top of a six-figure starting salary to try to entice new officers.And while Lovell said Idaho hasnt been immune to recruiting challenges, the state also saw a wave of out-of-state police applications around the same time other departments began losing officers.CRISIS IN NORTHWEST: ARE VOTERS BEYOND A TURNING POINT AFTER DECADES OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICS?ALL ROADS LEAD BACK TO FENTANYL: CITY OVERRUN WITH DRUGS SEES PROGRESS AFTER OVERWHELMED POLICE GET NEW HELPThe number of officers from other states who applied for certification in Idaho more than doubled from 2019 to 2021, according to data from the Idaho Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST). While the annual applications have dwindled since then, they remain above pre-2020 levels.Lovell said officers from other states have called him, looking for employment. Many were frustrated with local policies that defunded police departments or decriminalized drugs, he said.The district attorney doesnt back them, theres too much liability, so the department wont let them enforce the law, which is their job, Horst said. And that bugs a lot of people.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREThey get a job up here, oftentimes taking a huge pay cut because the pay here does not compare to a lot of states, he added. But its worth it to them to raise their families in a place that is safe and has those old-school values.An officer joining the Coeur d’Alene Police Department could expect to make between $63,000 and $89,000 per year before overtime, according to a recent job posting. The range is larger for the Idaho State Patrol, starting at about $48,000 per year but going up to nearly $103,000.But the biggest blue boost in Idaho comes from retirees, Lovell and Horst said.Retired police officers from Los Angeles, San Diego and other Golden State cities gather regularly for coffee, said Horst, who keeps up with several retiree groups. Around 40 former Seattle officers also live in the area, he added. It makes sense — California, Washington and Oregon are the three states fueling Idahos rapid population growth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Los Angeles Times reported last December that California public employees were leaving the state in droves and taking their pensions with them. The Boise suburb of Eagle received more CalPERS money in 2022 than any other ZIP code outside of California, according to the Times analysis.Im sure the state of California funds a lot of the stuff in North Idaho, Horst said.But the high concentration of former first responders offers something less tangible than money. It gives people like Horst, who moved to the area without already having strong social circles, a home away from home.To have that immediate bond where they can go and just feel safe, talk with somebody, share stories, that kind of resource is huge, he said. And I think thats a big draw for men and women that come from this world.;Right

I think everyone needs it. If we just focus on the dark things, were going to go to a dark place. So its cool to have it, and I think its definitely making a comeback, Josh Ocean Thomas told Fox News Digital.During a show earlier this month, Thomas, who does a lot of crowd work in his sets, asked an audience member named Nick what he does for a living. Nick revealed he worked for the Biden administration.You work for the Biden administration? Is your job to wake him up? Thomas joked.COMEDIAN SEBASTIAN MANISCALCO REFUSES TO EDIT JOKES FOR THOSE WHO ‘GET BENT OUT OF SHAPE’What a s---show of a job you have! I cant believe you admitted that in front of all these people, he continued. You have the freedom to lie. You could have said youre a hooker and I would have been prouder of you.Are you ready to be unemployed or whats your vibe, Thomas asked after further joking with the staffer about his job within the administration.Thomas told Fox News Digital he met the staffer after the show, and he was a good sport about the joke.The second the guy told me he worked for the Biden administration, it was over for him. I felt bad already because my brain went into comedic autopilot. Its funny, and thats all Im trying to do. Im not trying to make any points... its funny. And we were all thinking it the second he said [it], Thomas said.No one doesnt make fun of Joe Biden. Theres not anyone in the world that doesnt. Okay, everyone makes fun of Joe. Everyone makes fun of Trump. Everyone makes fun of everything. Its the world were in right now and this is what we need. We just need to do more of that.JON STEWART SAYS BIDEN ‘SHOULDN’T BE PRESIDENT DURING COMEDY SET: ‘WHY ARE WE ALLOWING THIS?’Thomas emphasized he is not a political comedian, rather, he pulls from real-world experiences and his own story to craft his jokes.I joke about life. All of my jokes are about my life or life experience. Some of them are made up life experiences, but theres stuff that like I would do. And like thing that like I would say. My standup is about me. Its not about the government. Its not about the right. Its not about the left. Its not about the green or whatever those other parties are, he said.The Chicago-based comedian has had a passion for comedy since he was around 13 years old, where he would perform at his first comedy club in his fathers living room for family, friends and neighbors.If they think that comedian got out of bed that morning and said, Im going to go on stage tonight and Im going to hurt peoples feelings and Im going to go to hurt people, that is crazy. - Josh Ocean ThomasA decade later, the 23-year-old broke out into the stand-up scene, starting his career during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, he hosts regular shows at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Chicago.From the beginning of his career to now, Thomas has observed an industry comeback as comedy clubs reopen and more people yearn for a laugh.I started comedy, there wasnt a comedy club open, which was the worst time because obviously they couldnt be open if they wanted to. There was a virus going around... but its when we needed them the most, he said.Comedian Karith Foster added on Fox & Friends last week that, despite cancel culture giving comedy a run for its money, most people can go anywhere and say anything right now.I feel like comedys making a comeback, finally, because it is so apparent, people are so disappointed, Foster told co-host Brian Kilmeade. And the fact that we are living like Groundhog Day over and over again, the same people, same choices for a major election. People are done, theyre tired.Both Foster and Thomas emphasized that despite what cancel culture tries to imply, comedians dont make jokes with malicious intent or hate.If anyone sees a standup comedian go on stage...and if they said something that might hurt someones feelings, if they think that comedian got out of bed that morning and said, Im going to go on stage tonight and Im going to hurt peoples feelings and Im going to go to hurt people, that is crazy, Thomas said. Every comedian I know is literally looking for the same thing… Were all looking for a laugh, and theres not a single comedian thats out there with malicious intent.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTheres a difference between coming at something with hate and coming at something with love, and true comedians come at it with love and its love of humankind. And thats why we have the ability to mock and to tease. If it was really nasty, it wouldnt be funny, Foster said.Thomas, who is a rising stand-up star, was optimistic about not only the future of comedy, but also the future of society.Theres always things we can work on as a society. I dont think well ever be perfect. I dont think we ever were. But I will say, I think were on the right track. And I think people are understanding that comedy is critical and it makes people happy. And we need that. And I am honored to be on the delivering side of that.;Right

Here are 5 reasons even he should learn to love the Trump tax cuts;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!No issue defines the diametrically opposite economic philosophies of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump than their position on the Trump tax cuts. Trump wants to make those tax cuts permanent, Biden has repeatedly promised to tax America back to prosperity by repealing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But there are so many factual errors swirling around regarding the Trump tax cuts that its a wonder that the truth screeners on the internet havent flagged this all as disinformation.So, as a public service, I will help do their job for them and review just the facts, maam, using the official government data, on how after five years the tax cuts have impacted jobs, the economy, tax fairness and the simplicity of the tax code.1. The Trump tax law was one of the biggest middle-class tax cuts in U.S. history. The Trump Treasury Department calculated that the average family of four saves roughly $2,000 a year. This means, sorry, Joe, repealing the bill would raise taxes for most families making less than $400,000. The House Budget Committee has estimated that the typical family will pay $1,500 more taxes annually if Biden repeals the Trump tax cut.MOM RIPS BIDEN ADMIN OVER ECONOMY AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: HARD TO LIVE IN JOE BIDENS AMERICA2. The Trump tax cuts vastly simplified the tax code for the majority of Americans. A major feature of the bill was to double the standard deduction from $12,500 to $25,000. As a result, prior to the Trump tax cuts, about one-third of tax filers had to itemize their deductions and keep track for the IRS of shoe boxes of receipts and other transactions related to mortgage payments, charitable deductions, interest payments and so on. Now nearly 90% of Americans – and almost all middle-and lower-income families – just check a box of the standard deduction.3. The Trump tax bill forces millionaires and billionaires in blue states to pay their fair share of taxes. One of the smartest features of the Trump bill was to cap the deduction of state and local taxes for the super-rich.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThis allowed millionaires and billionaires in blue states like New York and California to pay billions of dollars less in taxes than an equally wealthy tax filer in low-tax states like Florida and Texas. The old law encouraged states and localities to raise their taxes because it shifted the federal tax burden on to residents of other states.4. The Trump tax cut expanded the economy and business activity, which ended up raising tax revenues. A study by Heritage Foundation fiscal analyst Preston Brashers examines the impact of the Trump tax cuts after four years and found that the policy changes actually raised more revenue in its first four years than the Congressional Budget Office predicted without the tax cut.The House Budget Committee similarly concluded in a May 2024 analysis: The Trump tax cuts resulted in economic growth that was a full percentage point above CBOs forecast. Revenues were $200 billion a year more than was predicted before the tax cuts.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP5. The rich paid more, not less taxes after the Trump tax cut. Biden says continually that the major reason the deficit has exploded is that Trump cut taxes on the rich. Wrong. Five years after the Trump tax cuts, the IRS own data show the top 1% of earners in America saw their percentage of total income taxes collected rise from 40% to 46% of the total in 2022. This was the largest share of taxes paid by the rich ever.The truth is, almost all the negative claims that Democrats made in opposing the Trump tax cuts in 2017 were proven to be fallacious. Rather than admit that they were wrong, theyve doubled down in their commitment to policies that would raise taxes on virtually every American corporation, small business, family and investor. Perhaps the theme for the Biden campaign should be Putting America Last.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEPHEN MOORE;Right
399;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-fox-calls-state-dept-abandon-obsession-dei-depoliticize-new-report-says;First on Fox: Calls for State Department to abandon obsession with DEI and depoliticize, new report says;The State Department’s practices of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring has led to potential inefficiencies in hiring and concerns about the quality of employees in the foreign service, according to a report from The Heritage Foundation.Ideologically driven bureaucrats at the State Department are severely undermining U.S. diplomacy by artificially engineering equal outcomes in hiring and personnel decisions, through overriding objective criteria, Simon Hankinson, senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center and author of the report, told Fox News Digital.The world is on fire right now — as seen by the conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Yet, the State Department is wasting limited resources on an agenda that does not advance American interests and is not supported by data, Hankinson, who also served as a foreign service officer, said.My report lays out how the State Department can return to core American values and implement processes that prioritize merit-based principles. The American people deserve better.OBAMA STATE DEPT BLOCKED FBI FROM ARRESTING SUPPORTERS OF IRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN US: EMAILSThe report focuses on the hiring practices of the Foreign Service, which provides personnel to the U.S. diplomatic services and consists of over 13,000 professionals, insisting that the service must select its employees through objective, meritocratic criteria and are accountable to the president.We haven’t seen the report, but we welcome a diversity of viewpoints, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital.State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel argued during a press conference Thursday that the department welcomes diverse points of view and believes it makes us a stronger department, and it makes and leads to a stronger policymaking process.The secretary and department leadership will continue to seek out a wide range of views because we think it improves our policymaking process, he said in response to reports a career State Department official had quit over disagreements with a recently published report claiming Israel was not impeding humanitarian aid in Gaza.Hankinson lays out what he determines are a few myths about hiring and staffing in the State Department, namely that there’s a lack of racial and gender diversity, which the department resists, that structural barriers prevent minorities from entering the Foreign Service, that promotions are biased, that the department has a hostile work environment for minorities at State and they leave because of that hostile climate.HAMAS GAZA HEALTH MINISTRY UNDER MICROSCOPE AS QUESTIONS CONTINUE OVER NUMBER OF DEATHSAnother career official who quit over the Israel-Gaza internal disputes noted that while she found discussion on this topic unwelcome, it ran counter to the open discussion and welcome dissent on virtually every other topic over her 18 years with State, according to The Washington Post.The report argues that by separating the department’s 25,000 employees into their various intersectional components, the DEIA baseline seems intended to serve efforts by the department to achieve equity through race and sex-based preferences. (The A stands for accessibility.)According to the report, 35% of the current 26,000 civil service and foreign service employees are identified as minority, citing the State Department’s permanent workforce diversity data as of Sept. 30, 2023. Additionally, the report claims racial percentages within the workforce are within 10% of the national levels.The report quotes former State Department Director of Recruitment Woody Staeben as arguing eight years ago that the number of White officers among new hires had dropped by 30%, but that it will take much longer for the overall figure to change because the average Foreign Service career spans 27 years, meaning that issues with the makeup of the workforce reflect a delayed reaction to the makeup from years prior.STATE DEPARTMENT OFFERS CONDOLENCES FOR DEATH OF IRANS PRESIDENT IN ‘BAFFLING’ MOVE, HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER SAYSThe report’s most striking point — that the department stresses employees are held accountable to the president — derives from perceived resistance within the State Department to former President Trump’s policies, such as efforts to control illegal immigration, leading the report to accuse the State Department of having an increasingly left-leaning bias and arguing the bias derives from universities.Although there are approximately 65 appointees at State, (not including ambassadors), they are often unable to change policy in line with the vision of the President, due to bureaucratic inertia, ignorance of how things are done, and resistance from entrenched career officials, the report says. This systemic paralysis is a fundamental challenge to the principle that elections should result in policy changes.The most significant issue the report finds is the lack of emphasis on the Foreign Service Officer Test (FSOT), which former Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley dismissed as having zero correlation to being a successful diplomat while more subjective oral exams helped test for racists, or sexists, or homophobes or ableists, which she determined as things that we need to be screening for.Those who have the vast majority of senior [foreign service] positions are primarily European American men. … You don’t get to 87% of one group that is not 87% of the population and feel confident that all of those selections were made on the basis of merit, Abercrombie-Winstanley said during her 2023 testimony on diversity practices at the State Department.STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUES ‘WORLDWIDE CAUTION’ ALERT FOR AMERICANS OVERSEASThe report stressed the value of standardized tests, such as the SAT for college, the MCAT for medical school and the LSAT for law school, as indicators for success throughout a career in the given field.It stands to reason that accepting applicants with lower FSOT scores will lead to lower performance as those officers move through their careers, both to their own and to the service’s detriment, according to the report. The State Department’s Board of Examiners reportedly did not conduct any empirical research to determine whether higher FSOT scores correlated with career performance before deciding to de-emphasize the test.CLICK HERE TO FOR THE FOX NEWS APPTherefore, the report concluded that Congress should pass a new Foreign Service Act to restore the FSOT as a required entrance exam for the service, limit total annual recruitment into the service via fellowship and other channels that avoid the test, make promotion blind to race, sex and other immutable and irrelevant characteristics and require comprehensive annual reports from the State Department on the written and oral exams.The annual reports would include demographic breakdown, educational attainment, pass rates, language skills, state of origin and number of attempts of all test-takers. Additionally, the State Department should seek to eliminate duplicative and unvaluable positions and effectively dismantle the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.;Right

JAMES MEASE, PATRIOT WITH PASSION FOR ‘LOVE APPLES’Anderson was born to means on a southern plantation but raised in a society devastated by war.It was also a society that suffered a tragic loss of human capital. Male capital. More than 1 in 5 military-age men (about 22%) in the Confederacy were killed in the Civil War, according to several sources.Southerners responded with indomitable spirit. Anderson was among a new era of entrepreneurs and innovators burning with determination to overcome adversity.Many of them were women, later represented by the fictional icon OHara.Anderson built apartments in Alabama, herded cattle in California and, following a winter trolley trip in New York City, devised a way to keep the world truckin in a tempest.She didnt have a father, she didnt have a husband, and she didnt have a son.She didnt have a father, she didnt have a husband, and she didnt have a son, one of her descendants, Sara-Scott Wingo, said in a 2017 interview with NPR.And the world was kind of run by men back then.Cattle calls & trolley carsMary Elizabeth Anderson was born on Feb. 19, 1866, on Burton Hill Plantation in Greene County, Alabama, to John C. and Rebecca Anderson.The Civil War had ended only 10 months earlier. The conflict was followed by the economic hardship and social upheaval of the Reconstruction Era across the South.The Anderson family suffered its own loss in 1870. Mary was just four years old when her father died.Mary and her sister, Fannie, and mother continued to live off the proceeds from his estate, the late Dr. J. Fred Olive III, of the University of Alabama Birmingham, wrote for the Encyclopedia of Alabama.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO NEVER FLINCHED IN THE FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE, ABIGAIL ADAMSThe Anderson women moved to Birmingham and entered the real-estate business, building the Fairmont Apartments at the corner of 21st Street and Highland Avenue.Mary Anderson also sought adventure and/or fortune out west.In 1893, at age 27, she moved to Fresno, California, where she spent several years managing a vineyard and cattle ranch before returning to Birmingham.She also visited New York City in late 1902 and experienced northern weather, apparently for the first time.While riding an electric streetcar during a snowstorm, she noticed that the motorman operating the streetcar was shivering, Charles Carey wrote in the 2002 book, American Inventors, Entrepreneurs and Business Visionaries.She noticed that the motorman operating the streetcar was shivering … He was constantly having to slide open the middle pane so he could wipe off the glass.The author also wrote, Snow was sticking to the windshield, and he was constantly having to slide open the middle pane so he could wipe off the glass.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO MADE PRESCRIPTIONS SAFER, DEBORAH ADLER, INSPIRED BY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR GRANDMAThe driver’s vision was impaired, as was his operational ability. The situation created safety hazards for both pedestrians and passengers.The winter ride exposed to the winter elements was likely miserable for a woman who spent her life in warmth and sunshine surrounded by Alabama bougainvillea and California farmland.Upon returning to Alabama, writes Carey, Anderson gave much thought to the motorman’s plight.‘Teased and laughed at’Anderson spent the next several months devising a way for drivers to clean their windshields while still inside their vehicles.She appears to have possessed an innate mechanical capability. There is no indication that Anderson ever trained as a mechanic or engineer.But she emerged with a clever mechanism that displayed many of the hallmarks of windshield wipers today. She applied for the window cleaning device patent in June 1903 and received it in Nov. 1903.Modern windshield wipers operate via powerful little motors that deliver high torque at low speed with the twist of a knob. Drivers, with Andersons original device, operated wipers manually with a lever.The lever caused a spring-loaded arm with a rubber blade to swing across the windshield and then back again to [its] original position, thus removing droplets of rain or flakes of snow from the windshield’s surface, noted Lemelson-MIT, a program devoted to innovation, in its online biography of Anderson.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SERVED AS THE MODEL FOR HUCK FINN, ‘KIINDLY YOUNG HEATHEN’ TOM BLANKENSHIPIt is simply necessary for [the driver] to take hold of the handle and turn it in one direction or the other to clean the pane, reads the patent application.Similar devices had been made earlier, Lemelson-MIT noted. But Anderson’s was the first that actually worked.Andersons wiper worked. But it didnt sell.The inventor was teased and laughed at by many people because of her idea for the windshield wipers, said MIT-Lemelson.Anderson ran into a stonewall of doubt and opposition from the transportation industry and auto titans.We regret to state we do not consider it to be of such commercial value as would warrant our undertaking its sale, said one rejection letter from the Canadian firm of Dinning and Eckenstein.Anderson was teased and laughed at by many people because of her idea for the windshield wipers.Through no fault of her own, her invention was simply ahead of its time, and other companies and entrepreneurs were able to profit off her original ideas, reports the National Inventors Hall of Fame.A vision with rhythmMary Anderson died on June 27, 1953, at her summer home in Monteagle, Tennessee.She was 87 years old and is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Birmingham.Anderson was a widely known Birmingham resident and owner of the Fairmont Apartments, said her obituary in the Birmingham Post-Herald.Her rights to the patent expired in 1920 – just as autos were exploding in popularity and the need to operate them safely in bad weather grew more obvious even to auto titans.In 1922, Cadillac began building cars with windshield wipers as a standard feature, reports the National Inventors Hall of Fame — which inducted Anderson in 2011.The rest of the automotive industry followed suit not long after.Anderson lived long enough to see the world embrace the vision she had as a young woman in New York City in 1902.Windshield wipers today are found on almost every vehicle in the world — planes, trains and automobiles.Theyre on boats and trolleys too.Windshield wipers clapping time/I was holdin’ Bobby’s hand in mine. — Me and Bobby McGeeWindshield wipers are frontline troops in defense of public safety.

401;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-reelection-guaranteed-hurt-heres-how;Biden’s re-election is guaranteed to hurt you. Heres how;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!If President Joe Biden wins, your taxes will go up. It doesn’t matter if you’re a millionaire or middle class: the president has promised to raise taxes on every American who pays them. This would be bad for families struggling with inflation, bad for the economy, and it would be a massive expansion of the government at the last time we need it.Biden recently said that if he is re-elected, he will let the entire 2017 Trump tax cut expire. And contrary to Biden’s claims about that law, it was a huge tax cut for everyone, with the largest percentage reduction going to the middle class.The Trump tax cuts also reduced our business tax from the highest in the developed world, to far closer to the average, and cut taxes on small businesses to an average of less than 20%. This was good for investment, and it helped lead to the fastest wage growth in two decades.BIDENS WAR ON ENERGY WILL COST AMERICANS JOBS, WORSEN INFLATION, MONTANA OFFICIALS SAYBiden wants to reverse all these benefits and increase taxes by a devastating $5 trillion. In April, he pledged, That [Trump] tax cut is going to expire. If I’m reelected, it’s going to stay expired. This would represent the largest tax increase in history and would violate the president’s oft-repeated pledge never to raise taxes on the middle class.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThis proposed Biden tax hike would crush working families and add over $2,200 to the median American’s tax bill. What’s more, as business taxes go up at home, companies will be more likely to ship jobs overseas, meaning lower pay and fewer opportunities for Americans.Biden says his tax hike will only affect millionaires, billionaires and massive corporations. But that’s simply not true. Instead of crafting our nation’s tax policy based on growing the government, we ought to be guided by proven results and letting Americans keep the money that they earned — not the government.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Trump tax cuts worked and led to one of the greatest economies in history. The Biden tax hike would undue all of that, hurting our economy and our families.The good news is this doesn’t have to happen. After all, the three most important words in Joe Biden’s announcement are If I’m reelected. It’s up to us to make sure that doesn’t happen and that Trump tax cuts are extended.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. TOM COTTON;Right

Theres not ‘woke’ in the military. Theres ‘woke’ at the top, Trump said during the sit-down interview with hosts Pete Hegseth, Will Cain and Rachel Campos-Duffy.They want there to be woke, but these guys arent meant for woke. I would fire them. You cant have a woke military. You said it so great... You need people that want to win. They want to win wars. Thats what their purpose is, to win wars, not to be woke… but we do have great military.ARMY MAKES PROGRAM TO SHAPE UP OVERWEIGHT RECRUITS PERMANENT AS IT FIGHTS ONGOING RECRUITING CRISISThe official Facebook page for the U.S. Navy SEALs and Naval Special Warfare Command was mocked this weekend for marking the start of Pride Month.Backlash to the post surged when it was highlighted on the popular Libs of TikTok page on X, formerly known as Twitter. The post had no caption and included a photo with rainbow designs that read, NSW. Dignity. Service. Respect. Equality. Pride.Those are not the colors I care about. The colors I care about are red, white, and blue, Fox News Pete Hegseth told Ainsley Earhardt on Monday.We all wore green together. We all bleed red together. Who we slept with is not the issue... The issue is how good are you at your job? And are you being promoted because youre the best rifleman, or youre the best pilot, or youre the best tank commander? Not are you the first to this or are you the first that? And thats the story I tell time and time again.Libs of TikTok shared the post to X on Saturday, writing, The Navy SEALs have gone woke. Our elite special forces. This is terrifying.The post prompted a swarm of backlash from critics concerned about how the militarys priorities have impacted its military readiness as recruitment continues to be a struggle across nearly all the branches.I talked to dozens and dozens of actively serving men and women, junior enlisted high-ranking officers, and they all said the same thing, Hegseth said. Were walking on eggshells. Theres no accountability. The standards are being lowered, slowly eroded to conform to woke Marxist ideologies the Democrat politicians have pushed into the Pentagon. Pentagon should be the biggest meritocracy in the world. Instead, its a social experiment.BIDEN ADMINS MILITARY RECRUITING AND RETENTION CRISIS A SELF-INFLICTED WOUND. HERES HOW TO REVERSE COURSEMeanwhile, the Army, Air Force and Navy all missed their recruitment goals last year, prompting concern among critics who blame far-left ideologues who prioritize woke agendas over military readiness.The Army announced earlier this year the service is cutting its force by about 24,000 in a restructuring that it says will help the service fight in future wars.The almost 5% of jobs cut will mostly affect posts that have remained empty and not actual soldiers, and stem from counterinsurgency positions, cavalry squadrons, Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams and security force assistance brigades, which are used to train foreign forces.The U.S. military missed its recruiting goals in 2023 by 41,000, going into the new year facing a recruiting crisis, a Pentagon official said in December.A commander-in-chief needs to be focused on winning the wars we fight, and that means installing leadership at the Pentagon who are laser-focused on that, Hegseth said.Unfortunately, the incentives for generals under the Biden administration and the Obama administration was to conform to ideologies of leftist politicians who were ramming stuff into the Pentagon that has nothing to do with winning wars.What is your gender? What is your race? DEI, CRT, are we driving electric tanks? Are we saving the climate with the military? None of that is important to the men and women who I served with. We were focused on succeeding in the mission we were given, he continued.The Pentagon likes to say our diversity is our strength. What a bunch of garbage. In the military, our diversity is not our strength. Our unity is our strength, and we need a commander in chief that understands that. Donald Trump certainly does. Getting woke out will go a long way in making sure were the top in the world.Fox News Stephen Sorace, Anders Hagstrom and the Associated Press contributed to this report.;Right

Two hundred-fifty years later, the heart and lungs of liberty are facing what may be the ultimate stress test, Stephanopoulos said during his show, This Week.A jury found Trump guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the Manhattan criminal case on Thursday.While Stephanopoulos noted that other criminal cases against Trump had yet to be resolved, he told viewers, But for now, the New York jurors have already presented their fellow citizens with a choice: do we want to be represented, to be led for the first time in history by a convicted felon?

But that is not what’s happening this election year. Those bedrock tenets of democracy are being tested in a way we haven’t seen since the Civil War. It’s a test for the candidates, for those of us in the media, and for all of us as citizens, Stephanopoulos said.He warned that no other presidential candidate in history had faced a criminal trial, and added, No American president has faced hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for business fraud, defamation, and sexual abuse.At the glitzy Washington D.C. gala the night before, Biden told reporters that the stakes in the presidential race couldnt be higher.Move past the horse race numbers and the gotcha moments and the distractions and the sideshows that have come to dominate and sensationalize our politics, and focus on what’s actually at stake, Biden said.

Maher conceded that he could be persuaded in the other direction if presented with a good argument in support of a potential Biden victory.Swisher estimated there was a silent majority of voters — particularly female voters — who would never vote for Trump, and would back Biden in November as the less problematic candidate.Maher said that prediction was an absolutely possible scenario but he couldnt place bets either way.However, he argued theres an equal likelihood that the shy Trump voter gives the former president an edge over Biden.The shy Trump voter is the one whos going to vote for Trump, but doesnt want you to know it because its a little déclassé, he said, predicting this trend would be seen on Election Day even in deep blue cities.BILL MAHER, BILL BURR HAVE TENSE EXCHANGE OVER ISRAEL: ‘WHY AM I F-----G LISTENING TO YOU?’Maher also addressed his critics on the left whove said hes changed over the years because of his reputation for calling out the woke left.Thats so much more about them, he told Swisher of his liberal critics.

Anthony (SBA) Pro-Life America is urging Republican candidates not to stick their heads in the sand ahead of the 2024 elections, but rather paint Democrats as unpopular on abortion.Since the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision overturned nearly 50 years of precedent that effectively legalized abortion, Democrats have attributed political wins to the unpopularity of pro-life causes.But SBA said in a memo, sent to Republican leaders and committees Monday, that Democrats message is more fearmongering than fact, and it wants GOP candidates to emphasize that Democrats want to place America on a short list of the most pro-abortion countries in the world.HERE ARE THE TOP 4 MOMENTS FROM THE 2024 MARCH FOR LIFEThere are no protections for the unborn that Democrats can bring themselves to support, and they are consistently on the record opposing the protection of unborn babies when they can feel pain, even legislation to provide basic health care for a baby born alive after a failed abortion, the SBA memo says.Working with a pollster and former adviser to Trump, SBA says a winning message for Republican candidates involves stressing support for mothers at all stages of pregnancy and childbirth.The message that performed the strongest in moving voters is driving a strong contrast between Democrat support for the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) and GOP support for providing real options and support for mothers in need and opposition to the WHPA, SBA wrote. The research was conducted by Adam Schaeffer of Evolving Strategies, a behavioral science and political data firm.The WHPA passed the House in 2022, but failed in the Senate. Billed as a codification of Roe v. Wade, the measure goes beyond enshrining the 1973 abortion ruling and effectively would make it impossible to restrict abortion at any stage, according to SBA.In our test, the WHPA was characterized as sweeping federal legislation that would wipe away nearly all state limitations on abortion, even those that limit late-term abortions on healthy babies and ensure parental involvement when a young girl becomes pregnant, the SBA memo said.The other part of the winning message involved support for pregnant women and help for mothers – including expanding child tax credits.GOP support for mothers in need was characterized in our testing as offering women real options to choose life and embracing policies that would streamline adoption services, increase the child tax credit, make baby items tax-free, and provide funding to pregnancy care centers and maternity homes. Further, women should be informed about the financial help and adoption services available so she can make an educated choice, the SBA memo said.PRO-LIFE CONSERVATIVES ARE DISAPPOINTED IN TRUMPS NEW ABORTION POLICY, BUT STICK BY HIM: ONLY ONE OPTIONSBA said it is committed to delivering its message to key presidential and congressional battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Montana.But without individual candidates joining the messaging, SBA indicated that Democrats would continue to see success in their spreading falsehoods and fearmongering in favor of abortion access.Most importantly, candidates themselves must draw this contrast and put money behind it. The ‘ostrich strategy’ from 2022 of candidates putting their heads in the sand cannot be repeated. This is urgent for GOP Senate candidates, who continue to trail across key races despite President Trump holding a consistent lead at the top of the ticket across those same states, SBAs memo states.Trump has ruffled feathers in the pro-life movement for his approach to abortion following the Dobbs decision. He criticized Floridas restriction on abortion in most cases after six weeks of pregnancy as cruel, but has indicated he would consider a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks.He has also said abortion restrictions should be a state issue, pushing back on calls for a nationwide protection of life bill, but in numerous rallies and speeches has criticized Democrats for wanting abortion to be legal up to and after birth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats and their abortion industry allies will not stop until America becomes a global abortion factory where women are forced into abortion and find few options when choosing life, SBA said. If this happens it will put the pro-life movement in an even worse position than it faced under the Roe regime. We must unite and stop them before it is too late.;Right
411;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/tech/android-banking-trojan-masquerades-google-play-steal-your-data;Android banking trojan masquerades as Google Play to steal your data;Criminals constantly develop new ways to scam people, and their latest tactic involves infecting Android phones with malware to access banking information and other details. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Cyble have discovered a new malware, dubbed Antidot, which masquerades as a Google Play update application. It displays fake Google Play update pages in multiple languages and captures sensitive information.GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT’S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HEREHow does this malware enter your Android?As detailed by Cyble , Antidote is a Trojan – malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program. In this case, it impersonates the Google Play Store (the default app market for downloading and updating apps on Android phones) and captures your important data.Antidot enters your Android phone by tricking you into sideloading it as an APK (Android Package Kit). APK is the file format that Android uses to distribute and install applications. When you sideload an app, you’re manually installing an APK file on your Android device, which is not obtained through the Google Play Store. You won’t find it on the Play Store because Google makes sure to keep most of the malicious apps off its platform. However, you may come across it on third-party app stores or other less legitimate sources.The malware can also enter your phone through phishing emails and text messages. For example, you might receive an email claiming you’ve won something (a lottery, a phone, etc.). You open the email and click on the link, and either nothing happens or you are taken to a dummy site. However, malware has been downloaded and installed on your phone.VOICE CLONING IS THE NEW WEAPON IN SCAMMERS’ ARSENAL FOR FAMILY EMERGENCY SCHEMESHow does the Antidot trojan work?Once the malware is installed on your Android phone, it displays a fake update page featuring a Continue button that takes you to the Accessibility settings. Antidot relies on the Accessibility services to carry out its malicious activities as they allow it to gain complete control over your phone.The trojan displays fake update pages in various languages, including German, French, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Romanian and English, indicating that it is targeting Android users in these language-speaking regions.SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICESAfter gaining access to your phone’s accessibility settings, it can access whatever information it wants, whether it’s collecting contacts and text messages, harvesting credentials, locking and unlocking the device, or forwarding calls.To steal passwords and other credentials, Antidot uses a sneaky trick called an overlay attack. When you open your bank app on your phone, the malware loads a fake website that looks exactly like the real bank app and covers it up. When you type in your login details, the hackers capture them, and they can then steal your money, commit fraud or even steal your identity with enough information.If the malware doesn’t have a fake website for an app, it uses another trick called  keylogging , which captures everything you type on your Android smartphone, including your passwords.‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANS10 ways you can protect yourself from the Android banking trojanWhile a trojan is hard to detect and can be dangerous once it enters your phone, there are several things you can do to protect your data.1) Be cautious of phishing attempts: Be vigilant about emails, phone calls or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request.2) Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but it’s not enough to stop all malicious software. Historically, Play Protect hasn’t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any phishing emails or ransomware scams .

412;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/35-years-after-tiananmen-square-massacre-why-never-forget;35 years after Chinas Tiananmen Square massacre: Why we must never forget;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!The voices of the brave individuals who perished 35 years ago in the Tiananmen Square massacre continue to echo across our collective conscience.On that day, the People’s Liberation Army, acting on the orders of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) leadership, murdered and injured thousands of peaceful pro-democracy protesters calling for political reform and an end to corruption.The image of a lone protester using only his body to confront a row of tanks instantly became an enduring global symbol of resistance against oppression.It was a day of immense tragedy, described as a bloodbath in the center of a world capital. The massacre shocked the international community, while also highlighting humanity’s innate desire for liberty.BIDEN ADMIN SLAMMED AS GRANTING ‘MAJOR COUP’ TO CHINA AFTER TOP OFFICIALS VISIT ON TIANANMEN MASSACRE DATEHowever, compounding this tragedy is the fact that today, most people under the age of 40 in 21st-century China have little to no understanding of the events that unfolded on June 4, 1989.As reported by Radio Free Asia, educators are still forbidden from teaching about it, references to it are instantly removed from China’s heavily censored internet, and even public memorials for the victims are strictly prohibited.There is one clear reason why the CCP has tried to wipe this dark chapter in China’s history from its public discourse: fear.The shocking loss of innocent life, and the protests leading up to it, embody an unyielding demand for democracy and human rights – values that directly challenge President Xi Jinpings centralized and increasingly oppressive rule. Xi and the rest of the CCP believe that by erasing the memory of Tiananmen, they can stifle dissent and silence calls for freedom – and, to some extent, they have succeeded.TIANANMEN SQUARE: TAIWAN VIGIL REMEMBERS VICTIMS OF CHINA MASSACREThis is precisely why we cannot allow the memory of Tiananmen to fade away. It is why we have come together to amplify the voices demanding democracy for China, ensuring that the courage and sacrifices of those who stood against tyranny are never forgotten.Nearly a decade before that fateful day, the United States began engaging in normalization efforts with Beijing, believing its integration into the global economy would lead to greater civic freedoms for its people. Both Democratic and Republican administrations achieved some success in deepening diplomatic ties and widening people-to-people contacts and exchange programs, and U.S. multinationals reaped significant profits in the China market.But, they were wrong. The strategic gamble that economic growth and global integration would lead to improvements in human rights and neighborly relations was a fatal error, one whose victims are the Chinese people themselves.In recent years, the Chinese government has only gotten worse. Xi has intensified his control over his people while extending his nation’s authoritarian reach across borders through brazen acts of transnational repression.TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE MASTERMIND KNOWN AS THE BUTCHER OF BEIJING DIESHe has helped turn his country into an Orwellian surveillance state with formidable economic and military power, trampling over human rights with impunity, bullying its neighbors, and presenting itself as an alternative to democratic governance.In response, the United States has more recently shifted its approach to addressing relations with China to prioritize national security over economic interests. We are diversifying our supply chains, limiting China’s access to technologies and products that could further enhance its economic and military capacity, and strengthening our defense alliances across the Indo-Pacific. While successive recent administrations have taken important action in this regard, it has often been the Congress that has led the way.As we’ve learned before, this national security focus, while important, must not crowd out our focus on human rights. We must not overlook the aspirations and dignity of the Chinese people, who continue to strive for greater freedoms and economic opportunities in their own country.The concerns of the United States lie squarely with Xi and his government, not the people of China, and we must continue our staunch support for them in their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Doing so is both a moral obligation and a strategic necessity for building stable international relations and bolstering our national security.CHINAS SILENCING OF TIANANMEN TRIBUTES EXTENDS TO HONG KONGOur commitment to human rights around the world only holds weight when we boldly denounce violations wherever and whenever they occur, and take action. By uniting with a resolute voice at home, and drawing wisdom and strength from the lessons of history, we can pave the way for a more dignified and prosperous future for all people across the globe.This unity of purpose should clearly convey our nation’s support for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom against oppressive regimes, such as that of Xi, and forcefully condemn efforts to censor information, rewrite history, and suppress the truth about mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.This is precisely what I aim to achieve by introducing a bipartisan resolution honoring the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.This legislation represents a united call for justice, not only for the tragic events that transpired 35 years ago, but also for Beijing’s ongoing human rights abuses today, including the brutal repression of Tibetan and Uyghur communities. It highlights the systematic erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong and condemns Xi’s widespread use of transnational repression, which targets Chinese diaspora communities and activists globally.HONG KONG UNIVERSITY SAYS PILLAR OF SHAME STATUE HONORING TIANANMEN SQUARE DEAD MUST COME DOWNBy shedding light on these issues, we can underscore the urgent need to hold the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accountable for its human rights abuses and to counter Xis attempts to undermine international norms and threaten global security.In commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre, we honor the courageous spirit of those who embody what Nobel laureate and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo called the enduring human quest for freedom, be it in China or anywhere else in the world.We see that spirit in the people of Taiwan and their newly elected president, Dr. Lai Ching-te, who share the very same democratic aspirations as the thousands of peaceful Chinese protesters who were killed and injured on that tragic day in 1989.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWe ask our fellow Americans to join us in paying tribute to the heroes of Tiananmen Square by recognizing the sacrifices they made in pursuit of liberty, dignity, and self-determination.Together, through our shared support for democracy and human rights, we can give voice to those silenced by the PRC and ensure that the legacy of Tiananmen continues to inspire generations to come.;Right

Now, theres not one tyrant. Were all a tyrant because, hey, look, its my will, its my desire. And as long as I dont harm you, Ive got the freedom to do whatever I want. And then youve got a society of little tyrants who have no sense of cohesion or of a real common good.Philosophers of ancient Greece and the Christian tradition, Barron said, show that the purpose of government really is to make us good, and it has something to do with virtue. And that freedom is not, as youre saying, simply doing what I want. … Its actually a kind of disciplining of your desire to make the achievement of virtue possible.VATICAN DOCUMENT ON MODERN ISSUES SHOWS HOW STUPID IT IS TO SEE CHURCH AS LEFT OR RIGHT: BISHOP BARRONDeneen is the author of Why Liberalism Failed, which former President Obama praised in 2018. While Obama disagreed with many of the books conclusions, he said it offered cogent insights into the loss of meaning and community that many in the West feel.The book makes the case that liberalism failed because it succeeded, that the understanding of liberty as freedom from obstacles has led to a breakdown of society at every level, including the family and social institutions.At another point in the interview, Deneen decried the breakdown of contact between elite Americans, those who hold more political and economic power than most of the country, and ordinary citizens.I think the contemporary elites coming out of institutions like mine mix very little with ordinary people, Deneen said.THE MOST POPULAR CATHOLIC OUTSIDE THE VATICAN: BISHOP BARRONThat disconnect involves, in part, the political divide, condemned by populists as elites versus deplorables, but theres also a kind of non-prejudiced form, which is just not having any contact, Deneen said.It involves going from upper middle class to upper class suburbs to the best schools to Notre Dame to living with your graduate friends in Brooklyn and then going to live in wealthy suburbs and retiring in Florida, never mixing with ordinary people.The solution to the divide and the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few people could at some point require structural change, Deneen said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDeneen argued in his 2023 book, Regime Change: Toward a Postliberal Future, that America is headed for a fundamental transformation. His book advocated for a peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order in which existing political forms can remain in place, as long as a fundamentally different ethos informs those institutions and the personnel who populate key offices and positions.;Right

Netanyahu has flatly denied all the accusations against him.Fox News Digital reached out to leading legal experts who are well versed in the hard-charging and no-holds-barred electoral and judicial systems in both democracies.Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at George Mason University Scalia Law School and a scholar at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem think tank, told Fox News Digital, Israel has always been the canary in the coalmine for threats to freedom and Western democracy. The politicized prosecutions on obscure and incomprehensible charges and victimless crimes that has been used on President Trump greatly resemble the prosecutions of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Israels situation is worse – Netanyahu was indicted four years ago after years-long investigations, making the prosecution a never-ending shadow on his political career.NETANYAHU INVITED TO ADDRESS CONGRESS AS BIDEN URGES HAMAS TO TAKE ISRAEL PEACE OFFERHe added Moreover, in Israel, prosecutors are not elected or even politically appointed, so there is not even the bitter consolation that both sides can play the same game.He continued, But in what could be a good omen for Trump, Netanyahus political opponents thought the multiple criminal proceedings would end his political career, but instead he has gone on to win multiple elections because voters stopped taking the prosecutions seriously.Modern politics is filled with examples of court systems turned into blunt instruments to railroad politicians and dissidents who upset political parties and opponents.NY V. TRUMP: DEFENSE SAYS PROSECUTORS DID NOT MEET THE BURDEN OF PROOF, FORMER PRESIDENT IS INNOCENTPerhaps the most famous recent case is authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin’s imprisonment of his most potent political rival, Alexei Navalny, who was found dead in an Arctic penal colony in February. Putin’s critics claimed he was behind the killing. Russias opaque judiciary sentenced Navalny to a 19-year term for extremism. His defenders say he was persecuted by Putin because he was the first politician to build a national Russian opposition movement that seeks to end Putin’s more than two decades of control over Russia.In 2023, the late-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was found not guilty of witness tampering in connection with alleged sex parties, called bunga bunga,, at his villa in Milan. He claimed that his political enemies manufactured the sex scandal allegations.The controversial Italian politician died last year. He referred to himself as the Jesus Christ of politics. In 2013, however, Italys high court affirmed a conviction for tax fraud against Berlusconi.The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted as the country’s leader in 2022 and sentenced to multiple prison terms for corruption, including leaking state secrets. Khan argues that the cases against him are politically motivated and his supporters have filled the streets of the Southeast Asian country to protest his incarceration.Khan, a former cricket star who became an Islamist politician, is now facing 170 pending legal cases against him. The charges include terrorism, incitement to violence and graft. In March 2022, Khan claimed at a rally that a foreign conspiracy was working against him. He said a document showed that all will be forgiven if Imran Khan is removed from power. A month later, Khan was dislodged as prime minister by a no-confidence vote in the parliament.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerica’s former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who is a lawyer, told Fox News Digital, The most important feature of a functioning democracy is its ability to instill confidence in the fairness of its judiciary. In the Trump case, the prosecution and the court have pursued a frivolous case and done enormous damage to our democracy. I am less familiar with the prime minister’s issues, but it is clear that in Israel there also exists a significant part of the population that is losing confidence in the judiciary.Friedman, who served during the Trump administration and played a key role in relocating the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem, added, This is always a byproduct of prosecuting political opponents. When done, the facts and the law must be compelling and even overwhelming. That’s clearly not present in either case.;Right

Joining this alliance is often a sign of corruption, radicalization and even exploitation by outside actors, he added.Rev. Johnnie Moore, president of The Congress of Christian Leaders, also responded to the ban on X by saying, If the Maldives aren’t safe for Israelis then they aren’t safe for any of us.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Congress of Christian Leaders is issuing a global travel warning: no Christian should feel safe in a country where Islamic extremists determine national policy, he also said.;Right

Opposition candidate Gálvez had between 26.6% and 28.6% of the vote, and Álvarez Máynez had between 9.9% and 10.8% of the vote.

Mexico’s constitution does not allow re-election.The leftist has said she believes the government has a strong role to play in addressing economic inequality and providing a sturdy social safety net, much like her political mentor President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who is also a member of the Morena Party.PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RALLY IN MEXICO TURNS DEADLY AFTER STRONG GUST OF WIND TOPPLES STAGEOf course, I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum with all my respect who ended up the winner by a wide margin, López Obrador said Monday.

Look at the billions of taxpayer dollars President Joe Biden is pouring into community organizations in disadvantaged communities to tip the election scales.The community organizer who became president, Barack Obama, was a master at machine politics, using federal tax dollars to turn community organizations – left-wing not-for-profits – into a fifth estate. Their staffs, paid using taxpayer money but not tied to government rules, could hit the streets at election time and build turnout. Biden has scaled up Obamas playbook, using billions of dollars instead of mere millions.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made headlines recently with the discovery that in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded a $50 million environmental justice grant to the Climate Justice Alliance. Capito is distressed to learn that the Climate Justice Alliance vows the path to climate justice travels through a free Palestine.BIDEN ADMIN PRIORITIZES $900 MILLION FOR GREEN SCHOOL BUSES AS ILLITERACY PLAGUES US SCHOOLSIn fact, Climate Justice Alliance serves up a full agenda of radical activities, including fighting political oppression and placing race, gender, and class at the center of its climate solutions.But $50 million for the Climate Justice Alliance is a drop in the bucket.Had members of Congress read the Inflation Reduction Act before passing it – a novel idea – they would know the law provides $2.8 billion to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants, (Section 60201). Thats a license to hand out walking-around money to many political activists, not just the Climate Justice Alliance.Another recipient: the New York Immigration Coalition, which describes itself as a coalition of immigrant and refugee organizations pushing for more government services and political clout.Same is true of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, another recipient. The words climate and environment dont appear anywhere on these groups websites or literature.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Bidens open border policies. Money may shore up support.Lawmakers may have assumed the money was for climate improvement, but the IRAs fine print allows the moolah to be used for facilitating engagement of marginalized communities in Local, State and Federal public processes, such as advisory groups, workshops, rulemakings. Translation: elections.How easy is it to get the dough? Piece of cake. The EPA says it wants to alleviate much of the burden that the federal grants process places on small, resource-constrained community-based organizations supporting underserved communities and marginalized populations. In short, no jumping through hoops.The money can only go to a disadvantaged community or a southern border town. There are 27,521 disadvantaged communities on the census map, according to Bidens Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which targets non-English speakers, people with diabetes, and other factors that mostly correspond to heavily minority populations. These communities customarily vote Democratic.Adding eligibility for border towns is an interesting twist. As waves of migrants overwhelm resources in these towns, Democrats are growing divided over Bidens open border policies. Money may shore up support.During his first week as president, Biden announced the Justice40 initiative by executive order, requiring that 40% of many types of federal spending – not just EPA grants – must go to these disadvantaged communities.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe Department of Energy is spreading money to these disadvantaged communities, using what it calls community benefit plans and promising that application requirements will be intentionally flexible.The playbook started with the Affordable Care Act. The ACA, or Obamacare, authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hand out community transformation grants. Community Health Councils, a typical recipient, pledged that its mission was to advance social justice.It distributed 65% of the money to partner community groups that promoted voter engagement, conducted one-on-one education in the streets or led tenants rights, anti-fracking and anti-drilling efforts. And you thought the ACA was about covering the uninsured.A decade after Obama, Biden is tasking every agency and department of the federal government to promote voter engagement.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBidens community grants pale in size compared to the student debt cancellation vote-buying that now totals $620 billion.

The flimsy prosecution by District Attorney Alvin Bragg may have succeeded in harming Trump’s legal and political fortunes, especially in a close race. But it will come at the cost of unpredictable damage to our constitutional order.Once again, Democrats have sacrificed the institutions and norms that have buttressed our political stability to stop a single individual who threatens their vision of democracy.In last Thursday’s verdict, the jury unanimously agreed on a complicated set of facts that may well not add up to a criminal violation. It found that in 2016, Trump had paid porn star Stephanie Clifford (stage name, Stormy Daniels) $170,000 to keep silent about an alleged affair. That in itself does not violate the law.The jury must have agreed with Michael Cohen, Trump’s lawyer at the time, that Trump improperly filed these payments as legal expenses rather than as a contribution to his own presidential campaign. This might be a misdemeanor, worthy of a fine, but not by itself a felony.TRUMP V BIDEN: GUILTY VERDICT WONT SEAL THE DEAL FOR EITHER MAN. HERES WHAT WILL DELIVER A WINAnd the jury must have concluded that this bookkeeping error was secretly an attempt to enable some greater crime, such as violating federal campaign or tax law – even though federal authorities had not brought charges against Trump for the non-disclosure agreement payoff to Clifford.If this sounds complicated, it’s because it is – far beyond the abilities of a normal jury to understand. Trump will have strong grounds to appeal. Trial judge Juan Merchan may have erred in allowing the extensive, prejudicial testimony by Clifford, which had little relevance to accounting rules or campaign finance.Observers have already objected to Judge Merchan’s allowance of Clifford’s inflammatory testimony, his interruptions of Robert Costello’s impeachment of Cohen, and his bar on the appearance of Brad Smith (Trump’s expert on campaign law). Appeals courts have little interest in second-guessing a trial judge on evidentiary rulings, but Judge Merchan made several serious errors of law well-poised for reversal. For example, he allowed the prosecution to withhold the second, greater crime allegedly enabled by the bookkeeping shenanigans until the very end of the trial. This violated Trump’s constitutional right of clear notice of the charges so he could put on an adequate defense.In an equally serious mistake, Merchan allowed the Manhattan DA to enforce his personal version of federal election law. The Supreme Court has made clear in cases such as New York v. United States (1992), Printz v. United States (1997), and Arizona v. United States (2012), that the Constitution forbids state officers from prosecuting violations of federal law. The Constitution’s take care clause vests that authority only in the president and his subordinates.TRUMP GUILTY VERDICT REVEALS A DEMOCRAT PARTY THAT WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO WINYears could pass before Trump can take his appeals through the state appeals court system to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he would win solely on this last issue.In the meantime, the prosecution will have already wrought its destruction on our constitutional norms. First gone is the tradition of not prosecuting presidents after they have left office.In the 235-year history of the Republic, prosecutors both state and federal had left presidents alone. And this was not just because all presidents were as pure as the driven snow. Instead, elected executives had demonstrated the statesmanship to avoid using the criminal justice system to manipulate elections or punish their political rivals. Not only did Gerald Ford pardon Richard Nixon over Watergate, or George W. Bush leave Bill Clinton in peace despite the latter’s obvious perjury, but Donald Trump did not pursue Hillary Clinton for her routing of classified emails to her unsecured home computer network.DOES THE GUILTY VERDICT DESTROY TRUMP OR MAKE HIM EVEN STRONGER?Avoiding the temptation of criminalizing political differences is not just important to protect a stable electoral system, but to ensure an optimal president. The Constitution concentrates all of the executive power of the federal government in the president. It does this not because the Founders believed presidents would be perfect, but because they knew that only a single individual could act with the speed, decisiveness and energy necessary to respond to emergencies, protect the nation and wage war.If we allow any state attorney general or local district attorney to prosecute presidents – especially on the frivolous charges concocted by Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg – presidents will have to factor into their decision-making whether political rivals and opponents will turn to the courts to punish them. Presidents will worry about their litigation risk, rather than the risks to the nation.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe second norm gone is the rule of law, which at a minimum includes the idea that like cases must be treated alike. Bragg violated the rule of law by charging the former president with a crime – a bookkeeping misdemeanor upgraded to a felony by an alleged violation of federal election law – that had never been charged.People expect the courts to enforce the rule of law, but judges refuse to inquire into prosecutorial discretion – the principle that only the executive branch selects the cases to investigate. Courts cannot force prosecutors to drop cases because they have selected a specific defendant, nor can they force prosecutors to charge other defendants to ensure equality of treatment.The Trump case put on vivid display the principle that the most important protector of the rule of law are prosecutors and other members of the executive branch. They ensure that the law is applied equally in the choice of cases to bring and not bring.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt is for prosecutors to live up to the ideal that society punishes defendants for committing crimes, not simply for being unpopular. But in investigating Trump first and coming up with the crimes second, Bragg and his colleagues in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., have violated the rule of law.Progressives celebrating Trump’s conviction should instead be mourning the loss of the institutional norms that have served our nation so well for so long.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JOHN YOO;Right
421;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/female-athletes-like-us-suffer-biden-admin-allowed-rewrite-title-ix;Female athletes like us will suffer if Biden admin is allowed to rewrite Title IX;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!There are bad ideas. And then there are bad ideas that hurt people.Seriously hurt a lot of people.The Biden administration’s decision to radically revise Title IX rules does more than attempt to redefine sex in American law. It absolutely guts equal opportunities for women – particularly female athletes like us – and seriously endangers their health and safety in the process.No wonder so many lawsuits have been filed in just the last couple of weeks to challenge these new changes.WOMEN UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S TITLE IX CHANGES FACE THE ‘EVISCERATION OF LEGAL WOMANHOOD,’ EXPERTS SAYBy changing the definition of sex to include gender identity, the administration seems determined to force all Americans to ignore scientific reality and embrace radical gender ideology.The administration is convinced that gender identity trumps biology when it comes to defining sex under Title IX. No amount of biological evidence will persuade them otherwise.Men are, on average, bigger, stronger and faster than women. When men and women collide on athletic courts and playing fields, it’s the women who usually get hurt. When they try to share the same restrooms and locker rooms, it’s usually the women who get taken advantage of and preyed upon.It’s the whole reason men have their own teams, and women have theirs. It’s why Title IX was created – to ensure crucial protections, fair circumstances and equal opportunities.SIX STATES SUE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER NEW TITLE IX PROTECTIONS FOR TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS SPORTSYet the administration chooses to ignore all of those realities – and pressure the rest of us to ignore them, too – accommodating men who want to identify as women, even if that pretense hurts the women themselves.Clearly, this administration – which makes a great show of commitment to women’s best interests – isn’t really interested in women’s rights at all.They’re certainly not interested in protecting women’s privacy. Under the new regulations, women and girls will be forced to undress, sleep or shower next to males. All restrooms, locker rooms and even hotel rooms (on school trips) will be effectively co-ed, to accommodate those who identify as the opposite sex.The Biden administration is just as disinterested in protecting women’s safety. It’s not safe to put men and women in the same locker rooms, restrooms and hotel rooms. Things happen that could happen almost anywhere but are sure to happen a lot more easily and often when women don’t have the protections of privacy.BIDEN’S WOKE TITLE IX RULE IS SO INSANE, IT FORCES KIDS AND TEACHERS TO LIEAnd, finally – despite what they say – Biden administration officials are not remotely interested in protecting women’s sports. If the heightened risk and embarrassment of losing their privacy doesn’t keep many girls and women out of athletic competition, the forced integration of male athletes who identify as female into their teams and events surely will.Despite disingenuous claims by the Biden administration that these new regulations won’t impact women’s athletics, it’s clear that they will, in fact, have a devastating effect.There’s just no way to redefine sex in the laws regulating sports without affecting sports. And, given that the administration has been saying for years that men must be welcomed into women’s athletics, it makes no sense that they won’t seize this chance to enforce that agenda.The effects are sure to be devastating for women and girls all over America, too many of whom are already seeing their hard work and cherished dreams fall victim to the new fairness. We both know this from personal experience.HOW BIDENS NEW TITLE IX REGULATIONS EVISCERATE THE DEFINITION OF SEXMadison competed in cross-country and track and field for Idaho State University, where she was repeatedly forced to compete against a male athlete identifying as a woman – and lost every race against that athlete. After a lawsuit was filed to challenge Idaho’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) attorneys helped her to intervene in the case.Lainey played soccer at West Virginia State University. In her state, a middle-school male athlete competing on a girls’ track team beat almost 300 female athletes in three years – and denied two girls spots in the women’s conference championship. ADF attorneys assisted Lainey to intervene in a lawsuit filed against West Virginia’s Save Women’s Sports Act.Both of those lawsuits are ongoing, and one or both could reach the U.S. Supreme Court soon. Meanwhile, numerous other lawsuits – many filed by ADF on behalf of students, teachers and other female athletes – are directly challenging the Biden administration’s new rule.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONWe have taken this stand because – in school after school, state after state – the impact of the Biden administration’s agenda has been the same: frustration and disappointment, broken dreams and lost opportunities.As former University of Kentucky athlete Riley Gaines recently told a U.S. House oversight subcommittee, By redefining sex discrimination to include ‘gender identity’ in regulation, the Biden administration will be eradicating female-only sports, spaces and scholarships at institutions receiving federal funding.In all of these ways and many others, the aggressive effort to rewrite Title IX threatens the most basic rights and protections of American women. Their safety, their privacy, their potential to participate competitively in school sports – all of these are endangered by the changes being forced on us by an administration that thinks it can change reality.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden officials seem convinced their drastic revisions will raise awareness of their preferred ideology among all Americans.But – in reality – they’ve just lowered the boom on women.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MADISON KENYONCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAINEY ARMISTEADLainey Armistead is a second-year student at Stetson University College of Law and a former team captain for the West Virginia State University women’s soccer team.Both athletes are represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (@ADFLegal).;Right

And they hope their discovery leads to a new diagnosis that can provide answers to families.Those with the condition have a constellation of issues, which also include short stature, small heads, seizures and low muscle mass, said the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Nature Medicine on Friday.We were struck by how common this disorder is when compared with other rare diseases linked to a single gene, said Ernest Turro of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, senior author of the study.CHILDREN WITH INHERITED DEAFNESS HEAR FOR FIRST TIME THROUGH EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPYSyndromes like these can go unnoticed because the traits are sometimes so subtle doctors can’t recognize them by just looking at patients, said Dr. Charles Billington, a pediatric geneticist at the University of Minnesota who was not involved in the study.So certainly this wasn’t something that we necessarily had a name for, he said. We’re learning more about these syndromes that we recognize only once we are seeing the cause.Researchers said the mutations occurred in a small non-coding gene, meaning it doesn’t provide instructions for making proteins. Until now, all but nine of the nearly 1,500 genes known to be linked to intellectual disability in general are protein-coding genes. Most large genetic studies so far have used a sequencing technology that typically leaves out genes that dont code for proteins.This study used more comprehensive whole-genome sequencing data from 77,539 people enrolled in the British 100,000 Genomes Project, including 5,529 with an intellectual disability. The rare mutations researchers found in the gene, called RNU4-2, were strongly associated with the potential to develop intellectual disability.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe finding opens the door to diagnoses for thousands of families, said study author Andrew Mumford, research director of the South West England NHS Genomic Medicine Service.More research is needed, Mumford said. How the mutation causes the disorder remains unclear and there is no treatment. But Billington said labs should be able to offer testing for this condition relatively quickly. And researchers said families should be able to find and support each other – and know they’re not alone.That can be incredibly comforting, Mumford said.;Right
423;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/health/ask-doctor-why-hands-swelling-what-should-do;Ask a doctor: Why are my hands swelling and what should I do about it?;If you notice your hands are swelling, it could be both uncomfortable and unsettling, but in most instances the cause could be situational — caused by factors such as temperature, exercise, diet, medications you’re taking or certain health conditions.You may notice your rings aren’t fitting correctly, among other things.To find out more about the condition, Fox News Digital asked two doctors what causes hand swelling and what can be done to treat it.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘WHY AM I HEARING MY HEARTBEAT IN MY EARS?’Here’s what you need to know.What causes hand swelling?Most commonly, hand swelling is due to fluid buildup in the soft tissue.Soft tissue swelling, or edema, is not always a cause for concern, and can occur with weather changes or fluid shifts in the body, said Amy Kehl, M.D., RhMSUS, a board-certified rheumatologist with Saint Johns Physician Partners in Santa Monica, California.Most patients observe some degree of soft tissue swelling or edema with hot weather and with exercise, according to Kehl.Fluid shifts can also occur with too much salt intake, she noted, which can lead to increased hand or foot swelling, she said.Certain medications can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet.Additionally, certain medications, such as blood pressure medications like amlodipine, steroids such as Prednisone or Medrol, or hormone treatments, can contribute to soft tissue swelling in the hands or feet, Kehl added.What are the more serious causes of hand swelling?If a person notices an increase in hand or foot swelling that is not reversible or intermittent — or if the hand swelling is also accompanied by leg swelling with marked elevations in blood pressure or shortness of breath — medical attention should be sought, Kehl said.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO SWALLOW GUM?’A person should ensure they have had proper medical evaluation to assess both kidney and cardiac function, as hand or foot swelling can be an indicator of kidney dysfunction, protein loss in the urine, or cardiac dysfunction, she cautioned.Your doctor may order tests to assess your kidney function, urine studies or, in some cases, an echocardiogram.Diuretics may be needed to remove the excess fluid if it is related to cardiac dysfunction, she said.ASK A DOCTOR: ‘IS IT DANGEROUS TO CRACK MY NECK OR BACK?’Another possible cause of fluid build-up is lymphedema, which can occur if the patient has had surgery, such as a lymph node resection for breast cancer treatment, according to Kehl.This may be treated with local lymphatic drainage treatments, arm elevation, compression sleeves and exercise, the doctor said.Patients should seek medical attention right away if new and asymmetric swelling and pain develops.Individuals should also be cognizant of other symptoms.Certainly, if the hand swelling is associated with joint pains, this may indicate an underlying inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, Kehl told Fox News Digital. Again, an examination may be warranted to distinguish soft tissue swelling from articular or joint swelling.Patients should also be aware if the swelling is asymmetric.This can be a sign of something more serious, such as a blood clot, and patients should seek medical attention right away if new and asymmetric swelling and pain develops, Kehl warned.ASK A DOCTOR: HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY POSTURE?If a patient notices hand swelling in association with facial or lip swelling, this warrants immediate medical attention, she said.What are some ways to reduce hand swelling?If the hand swelling is deemed to be due to benign causes, this is typically reversible, Kehl noted.For instance, to reduce hand swelling after exercising, elevating the hands and performing arm circles may be helpful to increase the blood flow to the hands, she said.Similarly, it may be necessary to review your medication list with your medical provider to identify any pharmaceutical culprits.Typically, with discontinuation of the offending medication, the swelling should subside, Kehl said.ASK A DOCTOR: HOW CAN I PREVENT HIGH CHOLESTEROL?Diet should also be monitored.Staying well-hydrated can help keep fluids circulating.Maintaining the proper balance of salt and water is important, and reducing salt intake and following a low-sodium diet may be advisable for some patients, the expert noted.Lifestyle changes, such as movement, can also be incorporated to help alleviate the swelling.Stretch both arms up, move your hands and wrists, and make fists several times, Beth Oller, M.D., a family physician with Rooks County Health Center in Stockton, Kansas, told Fox News Digital.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERRunning your hands under cool water may help, she said, and taking off jewelry or constricting clothes while exercising can also help prevent swelling due to temperature changes.Staying well-hydrated can also help keep fluids circulating, Oller added.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPregnancy is another common cause of swelling. In that case, Oller said that moving the extremities can help.If swelling in pregnancy occurs suddenly or is extreme, talk to your physician immediately, as this can be a symptom of elevated blood pressure, she also said.;Right
424;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/health/traveling-internationally-could-illegal-bring-medications-pharmacist;Traveling internationally? It could be illegal to bring along these medications, according to a pharmacist;As summer travel season gears up, 77% of Americans expect to pack a prescription medication for the trip — but nearly half don’t check to see whether it’s even legal to bring those meds into other countries.Additionally, more than a quarter of Americans have had medications confiscated during international travel, according to a May 2024 survey of 1,048 respondents by SingleCare, a free prescription savings service. Certain medications that are commonly prescribed in the United States might be illegal or strictly regulated in other countries, Dr. Jennifer Bourgeois, PharmD, a pharmacy and health expert based in Dallas-Fort Worth, told Fox News Digital.5 SECRET SUMMER-TRAVEL PACKING HACKS TO MAXIMIZE CARRY-ON SPACE AND MINIMIZE STRESSHere are some important details on this topic.4 types of medications that may be illegal for international travelGenerally, medications that have a high potential for abuse or dependency are more likely to face strict regulations, Bourgeois warned.These include controlled substances, which are tightly regulated because of their potential for addiction and misuse, she said.Stimulants, which are used for conditions such as ADHD and are considered illegal in some countries, are also included in that category.OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY COULD DOUBLE AS KIDNEY DISEASE TREATMENT, STUDY SUGGESTSBourgeois shared the following list of prescription drugs that may be illegal to transport across the border.No. 1: Narcotics and opioidsMedications such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and codeine are heavily regulated or banned in many countries due to their potential for abuse, according to Bourgeois.No. 2: Psychotropic drugsDrugs for mental health conditions, such as amphetamines (Adderall), benzodiazepines (Xanax) and certain antidepressants , may be restricted.No. 3: Medicinal cannabisEven if they are legal in some U.S. states, cannabis and cannabis-derived products are illegal in many countries, Bourgeois cautioned.No. 4: Strong painkillersSome countries restrict strong painkillers , such as tramadol, which is an opioid sold under the brand names ConZip and Ultram, to treat moderate to severe pain.How to check legality before travelingBringing prohibited medications into a foreign country can have the potential for serious consequences, such as confiscation of medications, fines and possible arrest, Bourgeois warned.UTAH MOM FIGHTS FOR HER DAUGHTER’S ACCESS TO DISCONTINUED DIABETES MEDICATION: ‘LIFE-SAVINGIn severe cases, travelers may be detained, prosecuted and even jailed.Legal issues can also lead to delays and complications in travel plans, she added.Before packing your prescriptions when traveling abroad, Bourgeois recommends checking your destination country’s embassy or consulate websites and laws regarding medication.You may also consult with your doctor, pharmacist or travel agent, who may be able to provide advice tailored to your destination , she added.If there are specific restrictions for your medication in the country you plan to visit, it’s best to follow the directions from the country’s embassy so you can continue to take your medication while traveling.Bringing prohibited medications into a foreign country can have the potential for serious consequences.For instance, many countries allow only a 30-day supply of certain medicines, and require that you carry a prescription or a medical certificate from your health care provider, said Bourgeois.If you know that you’ll need a refill of your prescription while you are away, check with your pharmacy two weeks before you leave.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends making an appointment with your health care provider or a travel health specialist at least one month before you leave, as stated on its website.The pharmacist may need to request refills or a ‘vacation override’ from your insurance , Bourgeois noted.If your medication is absolutely not allowed in the destination country, Bourgeois suggests consulting with your health care provider to discuss alternatives and potential adjustments to your treatment plan.What to know before packing prescriptionsEven if your medications are permitted in the country you’re visiting, it’s still important to follow some basic guidelines when traveling internationally, according to Bourgeois.First, it’s important to always have a copy of your prescription or a medical document signed by your doctor explaining why the medication is essential for you to have.Exceeding personal use quantities can raise suspicions.On its website, the CDC also recommends leaving a copy of your prescriptions at home with a family member or friend in case you lose your copy or need an emergency refill.SUMMER TRAVEL: HOW TO PACK A CARRY-ON (AND NOTHING MORE!) THIS VACATIONAlso, keep all medications in their original packaging to clearly display the prescription label, Bourgeois advised.Additionally, she said, make sure the name on the prescription matches the name on your passport.Carry only the quantity you need for the duration of your trip, plus a small buffer, Bourgeois said. Exceeding personal use quantities can raise suspicions.Also, be sure to declare your medications at customs if required by the destination country, she said.All medications should be kept in your carry-on luggage instead of in checked bags. That way, if there are unforeseen travel delays, you’ll still be able to access the medicine you need.5 additional medication travel tipsBourgeois shared the following additional things to consider when bringing medication across the border.No. 1: Keep time zones in mindTaking daily medications for chronic conditions can be confusing when you travel across the world, she cautioned.In severe cases, travelers may be detained, prosecuted and even jailed.Pay attention to time-zone differences and take the medication according to your last dose, not the local time of day.No. 2: Check OTC rulesIt is important to check your destination countrys laws for over-the-counter medications, too, Bourgeois said.For example, pseudoephedrine — commonly known as the brand drug Sudafed, which is purchased over the counter in the U.S. — is prohibited in Japan and Mexico.No. 3: Don’t buy from non-pharmacy sellersIf you are traveling internationally , don’t buy any medications that are not sold at the pharmacy, Bourgeois said.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERCounterfeit drugs are common in many developing countries and quality is not ensured.No. 4: Stock up on staplesBefore traveling, stock up on over-the-counter medications and travel-sized items from the pharmacy, said Bourgeois.Common over-the-counter medications for travel include antidiarrheals, motion sickness meds, allergy medicines and medications for pain and fever.No. 5: Understand disease risksIf you are traveling outside the U.S., it is important to understand the risk of diseases in the countries you plan to visit.Diseases such as Hepatitis A, yellow fever and typhoid can be prevented through vaccinations , Bourgeois said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTalk to your pharmacist about vaccine-preventable diseases and request a travel health consultation to ensure you are protected, she continued.It’s vital that you do not wait until the last minute to get your vaccinations, as it typically takes up to 14 days for antibodies to build.Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for comment.;Right

Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were separate but equal.Marshall found this doctrine flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961.

Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.From Kings opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.Explore Kings profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.War Poverty Segregation Voting LegacyMARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY1. WarThe idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America, King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.2. PovertyDuring the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLEThe members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.3. SegregationKing fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.He famously delivered his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.Just four days after Parks arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end, he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLKS ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: WE STILL HAVE A DREAMA federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.4. VotingKing advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.Kings involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nations first Black president.5. LegacyAs King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF USWe have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But Ive come to believe were integrating into a burning house, King said. Im afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And Im afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following Kings assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he brought it on himself.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.;Right

434;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korea-agrees-stop-sending-balloons-manure-trash-south-korea;North Korea agrees to stop sending balloons with manure, trash to South Korea;North Korea agreed to stop flying hundreds of balloons carrying trash and manure to South Korea, saying Sunday it launched the campaign to leave its neighbors to the south with enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel.The Associated Press reported that North Korea’s announcement came mere hours after South Korea said it would punish the North with an unbearable retaliation over its balloon activities and other provocations lately.Last week, North Korea flew hundreds of balloons with trash and manure toward South Korea, prompting the South’s military to mobilize chemical and explosive response teams to recover objects and debris in various parts of the country.The balloon campaign came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged his military scientists to overcome a failed satellite launch and continue developing space-based reconnaissance capabilities. He described those efforts as crucial for countering U.S. and South Korean military activities, state media said Wednesday.NORTH KOREA FLIES BALLOONS CARRYING GARBAGE OVER SOUTH KOREA FOLLOWING FAILED SATELLITE LAUNCHThe wire reported observers claims that South Korea was likely going to restart front-line loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea, criticizing the country for violating human rights while also broadcasting world news and K-pop songs.North Korean leaders are sensitive to the broadcasts because most of the 26 million people living in the country do not have access to radio programs and foreign television.Kim Kang II, a North Korean vice defense minister, said Sunday that the country would temporarily suspend the balloon activities, adding they were a countermeasure against the South’s leafleting campaigns.We made the ROK (Republic of Korea) clans get enough experience of how much unpleasant they feel and how much effort is needed to remove the scattered wastepaper, Kim said in a statement carried by state media.NORTH KOREA TEST-FIRES SUSPECTED MISSILES AFTER US, SOUTH KOREA CONDUCT FIGHTER JET DRILLHe also said if South Korean activists send more anti-Pyongyang leaflets via balloons into North Korea again, they will resume flying balloons to dump rubbish hundreds of times the amount of South Korean leaflets found in the North.South Korea’s military said on Sunday that more than 700 balloons were found in various parts of the country, plus another nearly 260 balloons found days earlier.Tied to the balloons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, was manure, cigarette butts, scraps of cloth, waste paper and vinyl.

The November launch followed two failed attempts.JUSTICE DEPT MAKES ARRESTS IN NORTH KOREA IDENTITY THEFT SCHEME INVOLVING THOUSANDS OF IT WORKERSNorth Korea has maintained that it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles in the face of what it perceives as U.S.-led military threats. Kim has described spy satellites as crucial for monitoring U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhancing the threat posed by his nuclear-capable missiles.Given the fact that the security environment for our state is undergoing drastic changes owing to U.S. military maneuvers and provocations of all sorts, possessing military reconnaissance satellites presents itself as a prerequisite for our state to bolster up its self-defensive deterrent and safeguard its sovereignty and security from potential threats, Kim said.Although we failed to achieve the results we had hoped to get in the recent reconnaissance satellite launch, we must never feel scared or dispirited but make still greater efforts. It is natural that one learns more and makes greater progress after experiencing failure.North Korea hasn’t commented on when it would be ready to attempt a satellite launch again, which some experts say could take months.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPKim has been boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in recent months, highlighted by a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September as they align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.Kim’s meeting with Putin was held at a spaceport in the Russian Far East and came after North Korea’s consecutive failures in its attempts to launch its first spy satellite. Putin told Russian reporters at the time that Moscow was willing to help the North build satellites.The U.S. and South Korea have also accused North Korea of providing Russia with artillery shells, missiles and other military equipment to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine.The Associated Press contributed to this report.;Right

He had been at Coastal Carolina since 1996, taking the job after six years with USC Aiken. He had 1,116 wins with the Chanticleers.As he talked to reporters for potentially the final time, Gilmore took a parting shot at the system behind name, image and likeness (NIL) and how it’s been used in NCAA.CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COMIf you had a system (in professional sports) where everyone was a free agent every year, do you realize what chaos it would be?

That’s what’s going on right now.

These new payments and benefits come in addition to scholarships, third-party NIL payments, health care and other benefits that college athletes already receive, and schools can choose to make the new payments and benefits to athletes playing any Division I sport.As college revenues rise each year, benefits and payments to athletes will also grow, according to the settlement.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOver the 10-year settlement period, attorneys estimate that the total value of new payments and benefits that may be shared with college athletes will exceed $20 billion, making it one of the largest antitrust class-action settlements in history, the statement said.Fox News’ Scott Thompson contributed to this report.;Right

And just listening to the words … somebody would sit there for five minutes and sing this song for me. And I was literally, like, weeping, and Ill never forget that moment …After taking a brief moment to collect his thoughts, he said, Its hard to love people. Sometimes its hard to love God.

But you can take some steps to boost your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Here are some tactics to try.Increase credit scoreGenerally, people with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates. Steps that can help you improve your credit score over time include:Pay bills on time: Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.

Lower your credit utilization ratio: Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit-scoring factor.Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit-scoring factor. Avoid opening new credit accounts: Only apply for and open credit accounts you actually need. Too many hard inquiries on your credit report in a short amount of time could lower your credit score.Choose a shorter loan termPersonal loan repayment terms can vary from one to several years. Generally, shorter terms come with lower interest rates, since the lender’s money is at risk for a shorter period of time.If your financial situation allows, applying for a shorter term could help you score a lower interest rate. Keep in mind the shorter term doesn’t just benefit the lender – by choosing a shorter repayment term, you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan.Get a cosignerYou may be familiar with the concept of a cosigner if you have student loans. If your credit isn’t good enough to qualify for the best personal loan interest rates, finding a cosigner with good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate.Just remember, if you default on the loan, your cosigner will be on the hook to repay it. And cosigning for a loan could also affect their credit score.Compare rates from different lendersBefore applying for a personal loan, it’s a good idea to shop around and compare offers from several different lenders to get the lowest rates. Online lenders typically offer the most competitive rates – and can be quicker to disburse your loan than a brick-and-mortar establishment.But don’t worry, comparing rates and terms doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process.Credible makes it easy.

In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your credit score , debt-to-income ratio (DTI), down payment , loan amount and repayment term.After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an amortization schedule , which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.What determines the mortgage rate?Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:Location of the homePrice of the homeYour credit score and credit historyLoan termLoan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)Down payment amountLoan-to-value (LTV) ratioDTIOther indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:Current economic conditionsRate of inflationMarket conditionsHousing construction supply, demand, and costsConsumer spendingStock market10-year Treasury yieldsFederal Reserve policiesCurrent employment rateHow to compare mortgage ratesAlong with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:Shop around for lenders: Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees.

Consider a mortgage rate lock: A mortgage rate lock lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.A lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing. Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:15-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.29%6.29% Monthly payment: $2,579$2,579 Total interest charges: $164,186$164,186 Total loan amount: $464,18630-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.89%6.89% Monthly payment: $1,974$1,974 Total interest charges: $410,566$410,566 Total loan amount: $710,565Pros and cons of mortgagesIf you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:Predictable monthly payments: Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.

Potential rate changes: If you get an adjustable rate , the interest rate could increase.How to qualify for a mortgageRequirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:Have steady employment and income: You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company. Review any assets: Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts. Know your DTI: Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds. Check your credit score: To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment. Know the property type: During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property. Choose the loan type: Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, VA loans , USDA loans , FHA loans , and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs. Prepare for upfront and closing costs: Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.How to apply for a mortgageHere are the basic steps to apply for a mortgage, and what you can typically expect during the process:Choose a lender : Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits. Get pre-approved: Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts. Submit a formal application: Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents. Wait for the lender to process your loan: It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays. Complete the closing process: If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.How to refinance a mortgageRefinancing your mortgage lets you trade your current loan for a new one. It does not mean taking out a second loan. You will also still be responsible for making payments on the refinanced loan.You might want to refinance your mortgage if you:Want a lower interest rate or different rate typeAre looking for a shorter repayment term so you can pay off the loan soonerNeed a smaller monthly paymentWant to remove the PMI from your loanNeed to use the equity for things like home improvement or debt consolidation (cash-out refinancing)The refinancing process is similar to the process you follow for the original loan. Here are the basic steps:Choose the type of refinancing you want.Compare lenders for the best rates.Complete the application process.Wait for the lender to review your application.Provide supporting documentation (if requested).Complete the home appraisal.Proceed to closing, review the loan documents, and pay any closing costs.How to access your home’s equityIf you need to tap into your home’s equity to pay off debt, fund a renovation, or cover an emergency expense, there are two popular options to choose from: a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) . Both a home equity loan and a HELOC allow you to borrow against your home’s equity but a home equity loan comes in the form of a lump sum payment and a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.These two loan types have some other key similarities and differences in how they work:Home equity loan Home equity line of credit (HELOC) Interest rate Fixed Variable Monthly payment amount Fixed Variable Closing costs and fees Yes Yes, might be lower than other loan types Repayment period Typically 5-30 years Typically 10-20 yearsFAQWhat is a rate lock?Interest rates on mortgages fluctuate all the time, but a rate lock allows you to lock in your current rate for a set amount of time. This ensures you get the rate you want as you complete the homebuying process .What are mortgage points?Mortgage points are a type of prepaid interest that you can pay upfront — often as part of your closing costs — for a lower overall interest rate. This can lower your APR and monthly payments.What are closing costs?Closing costs are the fees you, as the buyer, need to pay before getting a loan.

449;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxbusiness.com/media/financial-dangers-store-credit-cards-severe-expert-warns;Financial dangers of store credit cards can be ‘severe,’ expert warns;Nearly every store has rewards credit cards available for customers, but not all the offers add up to major savings. These offers are often the genesis of long-term issues, one personal finance expert warns.Theres just a trickle effect that could last maybe years for that consumer, financial planner and What Should I Do With My Money? author Bryan Kuderna told Fox News Digital.Theyre like, oh, you know, I got 50 bucks off of buying that sofa that maybe I didnt even really want in the first place, and then… you look at what that did to their financial plan. And its kind of amazing sometimes to see what the genesis of [what] some of these issues was.FINANCE EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM OVER ‘SPAVING’ TREND: AN OLD ‘TRAP’ WITH A NEW NAME HITTING YOUR WALLETStore credit cards are similar to other spaving ploys from retailers designed to make consumers spend more to save. Unlike other deals, like buy one, get one sales, credit cards come with long-term financial risks.Retailers offer consumers two card options – a store card only accepted at a certain retailer or family of brands and a co-branded card that can be used widely. The cards are primarily pitched to consumers at point-of-purchase rather than having to complete an application process or go to the bank.The quick sales-pitch nature of the card pitch can rope in unsuspecting consumers and prompt a trickle down effect on their financial plans.A lot of people, they dont intend to open up a new credit card today when they go to Costco or Walmart or even when they sign on to Amazon or whatever the case might be, Kuderna explained. Then they get that alert or the person at the register says, hey, would you be interested in opening a store credit card? You can get all of todays purchases half off. You know something that sounds like almost too good to be true, which usually does mean its too good to be true.GEN Z LEAN ON CREDIT MORE THAN MILLENNIALS DID AND RACKING UP MORE DEBTKuderna went on to explain the severe financial dangers of impulsively applying for retail credit cards.[The cards] might be attractive. They might rope us in. But if we cannot pay off that debt, and were stuck paying the interest or any late payment fees and so forth, Kuderna stressed.With these kind of point of purchase offers, theres not time for homework, he added. Some people just say, I didnt intend on opening a credit card, but now here I am. I opened a card and now what is that going to be in over the next two years for myself, my budget and my credit score.Opening the card gives an initial hit to an individuals credit score with a credit inquiry. Credit scores are critical to buying power and can help consumers save on payments and interest rates for big purchases like homes and vehicles.After the initial credit inquiry, high interest rates, late payment fees and even inactivity clauses can bring recurring disasters for consumers.Oftentimes these type of cards have a low credit limit, which means as you use it, your utilization ratio looks very high, which is not good. And then, if were not using the card for a period of time, they may end up just closing the card on us, which then reduces our credit limit. Again, not good for our credit score, Kuderna explained.What they may end up spending in interest on their store credit card or late payment fees or anything else could pale in comparison to that little savings that they got at one time when they opened the credit card.CREDIT CARD DEBT IS SURGING AS AVERAGE AMERICAN OWES $6,218According to data from Bankrate, interest rates for retail credit cards have hit a new record high at 28.93% as of October 2023. Kuderna warned the high rates make it difficult for shoppers to maximize the cards incentives and can lead to customers paying more in interest than they are making in savings.If you simply look at that math there, you could see how much in favor that is to the issuing company, the credit card company or the retail store. - Bryan KudernaThe interest that theyre going to charge, the possible penalties that could be involved, the fine print on the card, the inactivity clauses, if youre not using the card, there could be so many strings attached.Retail cards also often provide offers for young buyers and shoppers with poor credit to acquire a new credit card. Subprime lending, also called predatory lending, can be a great opportunity, but it is also an aspect which Kuderna says consumers should be extremely careful about.The spaving offer also acts similar to a subscription model. If a retailer can hook in a customer with a store card, it can create a returning buyer and potentially increase profits for that retailer. It also means consumers must face difficult choices when it comes to finances.Were doing all that for just this immediate gratification because of the intro offer. But again, the long-term effects here. We dont notice them immediately, but theyre there. And then, as they compound with other department stores, other online retailers, thats where people can really get in a mess without having intended to ever be there, Kuderna explained.While there are severe pitfalls to opening a retail card, Kuderna outlined that the credit cards could be a win-win, but you really need to do some homework on that.For those looking to open a store card, Kuderna urged consumers to evaluate the kind of card they applied for and whether the particular retailer is a place one shops frequently. In addition, consumers who do apply for a card should practice paying off balances immediately.Other tips include viewing the retail card like any conventional credit card, practicing good budgeting and remembering not to take on more debt than you are capable of paying off.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE;Right

451;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/tech/7-things-google-just-announced-that-are-worth-keeping-close-eye-on;7 things Google just announced that are worth keeping a close eye on;Googles flagship developer conference called I/O just wrapped up with interesting leaps in how the Big Tech giant is planning to change the world.Here are the seven biggest things we learned from Google at I/O 2024.Googles injecting AI into nearly every aspect of its products and servicesGoogles I/O event was largely an opportunity for it to make its case to developers — and, to a lesser extent, consumers — as to why its artificial intelligence is ahead of rivals Microsoft and OpenAI. Heres a rundown of the seven highlights to keep an eye on. Googles AI, named Gemini, was featured prominently at the I/O conference and is now available to developers worldwide.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTERAccording to the conference, Gemini is now capable of pulling information from text, photos, audio, web pages and live videos from your phones camera and is able to synthesize the information it receives and answer questions you may have about it. Heres what the Gemini improvements look like in practice.1. Phone call scam detection coming to Android could compromise your privacyGoogle showed a demo for its phone call scam detection feature, which the company says will be coming to a future version of Android. How it works is revolutionary and concerning. The feature will scan voice calls as they occur in real time, and it’s already drawing enormous privacy concerns. It would be like allowing your phone calls to be tapped and monitored by Big Tech instead of Big Brother.However, Google says, This protection all happens on device, so your conversation stays private to you. This means that you will have the choice to turn this feature on, and if you have it on, your conversation doesnt leave your device since the AI protection works directly on your device, so its impossible for Google or anyone else to hear it.Apple had planned a similar feature on iOS back in 2021 but abandoned it after backlash from privacy advocates. Google is under similar pressure, with privacy advocates worried that the company notorious for harvesting and profiting from personal data might soon misuse AI voice scanning technology.IS THE FTC CALLING YOU? PROBABLY NOT. HERES HOW TO AVOID A NEW PHONE SCAM TARGETING YOU2. ‘Ask Photos’ will let AI help you find out about specific things in photosGoogle unveiled a new feature called Ask Photos, in which users can ask Gemini to search for their photos and deliver exact results. One example showcased was the use of Gemini to locate images of your car in your photo album by telling it your license plate number.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS. CLICK TO GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER3. An AI button is coming to many of Google’s most popular productivity toolsStarting immediately, Google has added a button to toggle Gemini AI in the side panel of several of its Google Suite apps, including Gmail, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets and Slides. Similar to Microsofts Co-Pilot AI function, the Gemini button can help answer questions, craft emails and provide summaries of documents and email threads.HOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM GMAIL SIGNATURE4. AI tool called ‘Veo’ makes video from textWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?On a more experimental note, Google also unveiled its VideoFX feature, a generative video model based on Googles DeepMind video generator, Veo. VideoFX can create Full HD (1080p) videos from text prompts, and we also saw improvements made to ImageFX, Googles high-resolution AI image generator.For musicians, Google also showed their new DJ Mode in MusicFX, an AI music generator that can be used to create loops and samples from prompts.QUICK TIPS. EXPERT INSIGHTS. CLICK TO GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER5. AI summaries will replace search resultsGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERETheres been a lot of press lately regarding how difficult searching for things on Google has become. Constant changes to search engine optimization as well as a new wave of bots and AI-created content has disrupted the once monolithic search engine. However, Google showed off its new AI-organized search, which promises more readable search results.Google also showed off how it is using AI to create overviews, which are short summaries to help you answer questions posed in the search box. These summaries will appear at the top of the search results page, so you dont even need to visit another website to get answers you may be looking for.6. Google TV gets the AI treatmentGoogle managed to work its Gemini AI into its Google TV smart TV operating system, allowing it to generate descriptions for movies and TV shows. When you are viewing content that is missing a description, Gemini will fill it in automatically. Gemini on Google TV will also now translate descriptions into the viewers native language, making it easier to find international shows and movies to watch.7. AI for educational purposesHOW TO DELETE EVERYTHING FROM YOUR GOOGLE SEARCHESGoogle also unveiled LearnLM, a new generative AI model that is designed for education. It comes as a collaboration between Googles DeepMind AI research division and Googles Research lab. LearnLM is designed as a chatbot that looks to tutor students on a range of subjects, from mathematics to English grammar.EXPERT TIPS, LEGIT REVIEWS. GET THE FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTERKurts key takeawaysIf you missed Google I/O 2024, here’s the scoop: Google’s AI, Gemini, stole the show with its ability to integrate information from various media and answer your queries on the fly. Noteworthy features include a call scam detection for Android, a photo search tool that can find your car using your license plate number and the integration of Gemini into Google’s Workspace suite for smarter document handling.Plus, Google’s new AI-powered search promises more readable results, and Google TV now boasts AI-generated content descriptions. For creatives and learners, Google introduced VideoFX for AI-generated videos, MusicFX’s DJ Mode for music creation and LearnLM, an AI tutor for students. It’s clear that Google is betting big on AI to keep ahead of the competition.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAre there any concerns that you believe should be addressed as these technologies become more integrated into our personal and professional environments?

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and a slew of holdovers. Flipping the script from their Memorial weekend openings, the animated orange cat crept ahead of the wasteland warrior in their second outing. The Garfield Movie earned a chart-topping $14 million in ticket sales while Furiosa settled into third place in a close race with IF, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Both IF and Furiosa are estimated to have earned $10.8 million, with IF getting the slight edge.Garfield fell only 42% in its second weekend in North America. It also topped the global box office adding $27 million from international territories, bringing its running worldwide to $152.2 million. The animated pic featuring the voice of Chris Pratt will essentially have the market to itself until Inside Out 2 arrives on June 14.AMERICAN CULTURE QUIZ: TEST YOUR COMMAND OF HOLLYWOODS HOTTEST SOUNDTRACKS, HIGH COST OF FREEDOM AND MOREFuriosa, meanwhile, fell 59% from its first weekend, adding just under $10.8 million from 3,864 locations in the U.S. and Canada. That puts its running domestic total at $49.7 million and its global sum at $114.4 million against a $168 million production budget.There were several new releases that opened on over 1,000 screens this weekend: Sony/Crunchyroll’s anime Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle, IFC’s horror In a Violent Nature, Roadside Attractions’ Diane Keaton-Alfre Woodard-Kathy Bates comedy Summer Camp, And Bleecker Street’s father-son drama Ezra. None managed to crack the top five, however.Disney also released the well-reviewed  Young Woman and the Sea, starring Daisy Ridley as the first woman to swim the English Channel, but did not report its ticket sales. Likewise, Richard Linklaters  Hit Man  is currently playing in select theaters around the country before it comes to streaming next week, but Netflix does not release box office numbers.Second place went to Paramount’s  IF, with $10.8 million in its third weekend. John Krasinski’s imaginary friends fantasy starring Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming has now made over $80.4 million domestically and $138 million worldwide. Disney/20th Century Studios’  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes  landed in fourth place in its fourth weekend with $8.8 million. It has now made $140 million domestically and $337.1 million globally.And the Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt action-comedy  The Fall Guy,  which is currently available to purchase at home, rounded out the top five with $4.2 million, bringing its domestic total to $80.3 million. Globally, the Universal release has made $157.9 million.Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle, based on the Japanese high school volleyball series, made an estimated $3.5 million from 1,119 locations. The slasher In a Violent Nature opened to $2.2 million from 1,426 locations (a massive release for IFC Films and Shudder). And, Ezra, about a stand-up comedian (Bobby Cannavale) and his autistic son, earned $1.2 million from 1,320 screens.The 2024 box office is struggling compared to both last year (down 23.9%) and pre-pandemic standards (down 42.2% from 2019 and 46.4% from 2018), according to data from Comscore. On this weekend last year, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse opened to $120.7 million while The Little Mermaid was still pulling in over $41.4 million in its second weekend. This year has yet to have any film open to over $100 million domestically.While Barbie and Oppenheimer had yet to storm theaters at this point last year, there had been several substantial hits including The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.36 billion global total), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($845.5 million) and Fast X ($704.7 million).It should come as no surprise given the nature of this year’s trajectory that we are running this far behind, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. I understand why people are concerned about where this year is going, but it’s never too late to get things running again.It’s a momentum business, he added. The attention right now is focused on what will be the big movie to get the summer moving in the right direction.That big summer movie could arrive in the form of Inside Out 2, which could open to over $85 million according to early projections, and propel other juggernauts like Despicable Me 4 (July 3) and Deadpool & Wolverine (July 26).Dergarabedian also noted that absent a big superhero movie, its the family-oriented films that have been resonating recently. They might not open to the biggest numbers, but as IF and The Garfield Movie have proven, they have staying power.The top-grossing movie of this year remains Dune: Part Two, which Warner Bros. released in early March and has made over $711 million globally. Its domestic take of $282.1 million represents 10.5% of the overall box office for 2024.Dune filmmaker Denis Villeneuve over the weekend said that he was disappointed to still be number one while at the Canadian Screen Awards in Toronto where he was collecting an award.I hope soon that there will be other successes at the box office, Villeneuve said, as reported by Yahoo.

There are so many people who deserve to have this kind of life who don’t, but I think I’m comfortable with not deserving it and doing it anyway. And I know that my not doing it wouldn’t help anyone.MAYA HAWKE ANNOYED WITH HER FAMOUS PARENTS GENERATION: THEY REALLY F---ED USShe continued, I saw two paths when I was first starting, and one of them was: change your name, get a nose job and go to open casting roles.Hawke is fine with people mocking her privilege though.It’s OK to be made fun of when you’re in rarefied air. It’s a lucky place to be. My relationships with my parents are really honest and positive, and that supersedes anything anyone can say about it, she told the outlet.The 25-year-old got her first major onscreen role in the 2017 Little Women BBC miniseries, before landing her best known role on Stranger Things in 2019.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERThat same year, she also appeared in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as a Charles Manson acolyte, alongside other nepo babies like Margaret Qualley (daughter of Andie MacDowell) and Rumer Willis (daughter of Bruce Willis).Hawke fully admits nepotism had a hand in her being cast in the film, clarifying a previous comment about auditioning.I’ve been wildly made fun of for this clip when I said, on the red carpet, that I auditioned, she said.She explained though she had made an audition tape, she never meant to imply that I didn’t get the part for nepotistic reasons — I think I totally did.ALLISON WILLIAMS ADMITS FAMOUS FATHER CONNECTION HELPED HER GET ACTING GIG: NOT AS FUN TO ROOT FOR MEHawke added that Tarantino was making an active effort to cast a lot of young Hollywood, which included a lot of second generation stars like Qualley and Willis.She also addressed the falling out her mother had with Tarantino, who had directed her in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol 2.Thurman and Tarantino stopped collaborating after she was injured in a car crash on set, during which he had insisted she do her own stunts. He told Deadline in 2018 one of the biggest regrets of my career and his life.Thurman told Entertainment Weekly that made it seem that their tensions had healed, saying, I understand him and if he wrote a great part and we were both in the right place about it, that would be something else.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

The median asking price for a typical home on the market also fell by about $3,000 to $417,000, the first time that prices had decelerated in six months.On top of that, the number of days active listings have been on the market started to rise in May for the first time in eight months, hitting a median of 46 days.MORTGAGE CALCULATOR: SEE HOW MUCH HIGHER RATES COULD COST YOUTogether, the metrics suggest that sale-price growth could soften in the coming months as persistently high mortgage rates turn off homebuyers, the report said.While buyers received a modicum of relief on housing costs at the end of May – monthly housing payments dropped to a six-week low thanks to a modest decline in mortgage rates – many Americans are still paying a record-high amount to buy a house.The median home sale price hit $390,613, according to the report, the highest level on record and a 4.3% increase from the same time last year.There are a number of driving forces behind the affordability crisis.WHY CANT YOU FIND A HOME FOR SALE?Years of underbuilding fueled a shortage of homes in the country, a problem that was later exacerbated by the rapid rise in mortgage rates and expensive construction materials.Higher mortgage rates over the past three years have also created a golden handcuff effect in the housing market. Sellers who locked in a record-low mortgage rate of 3% or less during the pandemic began have been reluctant to sell, limiting supply further and leaving few options for eager would-be buyers.Economists predict that mortgage rates will remain elevated for most of 2024 and that they will only begin to fall once the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates. Even then, rates are unlikely to return to the lows seen during the pandemic, with investors predicting just one or two rate reductions this year.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year loan rose slightly to 7.04%.

It explores the power of self-love and features self-reflection for the readers to better understand their hopes and dreams.In the book, the 70-year-old looked back at her husband Frank Gifford’s extramarital affair. The Emmy Award-winning TV host told Fox News Digital that her faith in God taught her the power of forgiveness after facing a painful betrayal.KATHIE LEE GIFFORD SAYS HOWARD STERN ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS AFTER FEUD: GOD CAN TOUCH ANYBODYS HEARTFirst of all, I loved Frank, Gifford told Fox News Digital. I was pissed at him, believe me. And furious that he would take something as precious as our marriage into a hotel room with somebody. It was so unlike him. And he put his whole family at risk because of it. But I also knew that we had a family that we loved.Gifford shared that when you hurt, you pray. And it was love, she said, that gave her the courage to forgive.I did it to save our marriage because I loved Frank, she explained. I was not going to break up our family. Nope… A man said to me once, ‘Kathie, if you can’t forgive your husband, forgive your children’s father.’ I said, ‘Well, that guy’s wonderful. That guy is a beautiful human being.’ He said, ‘Then forgive that guy.’ It worked.I was never the same though, Gifford admitted. People take sex so casually, and it pretty much did me in for a long time. But I just went back to work, thanked everybody for their prayers and tried to avoid any newspapers for a long, long time.According to the book, Frank met a woman at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue in New York City on May 1, 1997. Gifford wrote that for years after the affair, she avoided driving down Park Avenue to avoid being triggered by hurtful emotions. With the help of a counselor, Gifford was able to forgive her husband.My whole faith is built on the foundation of forgiveness: Jesus died for me for the forgiveness of my sins, Gifford wrote. We cannot withhold from others what He has freely given to us.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERIn the book, Gifford described how she struggled to see her husband the same way after the affair, noting he wasn’t my hero anymore. Still, she did not have any regrets about forgiving him.My children’s father was a wonderful, loving, gentle, compassionate, generous, and sweet man, she wrote. He was easy to forgive because I knew his heart.I prayed an almost impossible prayer, she wrote. ’Lord, please give me a deeper desire for Frank than I have ever had for him, even more than at the beginning.’ This was an epic request. I was crazy in love with Frank then, and grateful to finally have the kind of exciting, thrilling, ecstatic love I’d only known about from books or movies. To my surprise, God answered my prayer and gave me a desire for Frank, unlike anything we had ever experienced. Every time we made love, it was truly healing for me.The laughter returned, and our children grew up to be the most extraordinary two human beings I’ve ever known, Gifford continued. By the time they learned the truth of what had happened, they knew an even deeper truth: their parents loved them and each other enough to trust in God’s healing.Our lives can take some unexpected twists and turns. Some come as the result of our choices, other times it’s because of someone else’s. No matter how hard things might become, it’s never too late to bring beauty from the ashes. If you find yourself in such a place as I did – in the midst of a season of great difficulty – take a deep breath, prayerfully face the truth, find a Christian counselor to help you figure out your next steps, and trust God to lead you through.When the news of Frank’s infidelity became public, it was their pal, Rev. Billy Graham, who called.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSI watched as Billy’s words of mercy and grace washed over [Frank], Gifford wrote. I could see his eyes well up with tears as he heard Billy’s magnificent voice tell him, ‘Remember, Frank, there is no condemnation in Christ. We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.’ ‘Thank you, Billy,’ was all Frank could say… Thank you, Billy Graham. Thank you. Forever.Gifford told Fox News Digital that what she remembers most about Graham is his kindness to me. The Evangelist died in 2018 at age 99.I met him when I was in my 20s, said Gifford. He remained one of my best friends my whole life. He said something very, very important early on. He said, ‘Kathie, you’re going to have a big career in the entertainment industry. But I just want to let you know that I have nothing I regret in life except for getting involved a few times with politics. I would never do that again. You instantly lose half your audience. If I were you, I would keep my message the same for the rest of your life and your career. Be the same person on camera, off camera, wherever you are. Just tell people that Jesus loves them.’That’s what I’ve done, said Gifford. He gave me the boldness to say it. A lot of people will whisper to me, ‘I’m a believer, too.’ I go, ‘Why are you whispering?’ A lot of people are afraid to even be open about their faith, open about their politics, open about who they are… [But] I have to be bold for Him. I have to be.While Gifford never got over Frank’s infidelity, their love endured. The beloved patriarch passed away in 2015 at age 84.It’s like when you have a scar, she told Fox News Digital. Maybe the wound’s not there anymore, but the remembrance of it is. I think marriage is a sacred, sacred relationship, and I was never the same. No, I never was.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPeople come up to me a lot… They’ll say, ‘I just want you to know that because you stayed in your marriage, I stayed in mine. And we’ve been happily married ever since we got over it.’ Marriage is hard. Falling in love is easy. Staying in love is hard work.;Right

Its just tremendous.Back on Earth, the professionals at mission control were just a hair more concerned about Whites safety, the NASA website notes.Gemini 4, get back in, Virgil Gus Grissom reportedly yelled at White.Grissom, a fellow astronaut, was serving as CapCom during Gemini 4.White initially pushed back against the request to end the spacewalk, saying he was doing great and that the experience was fun before he gave in, NASA revealed.FIRST MEN ON THE MOON, A UNIQUE AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT, STILL AMAZES US TODAYI’m coming back in … and it’s the saddest moment of my life, said White when he finally agreed to reenter the capsule.In addition to the first U.S. EVA, Gemini 4 was another milestone mission in NASAs history. It was the first multi-day space flight by the United States, although it was shorter than a previous Soviet space flight.It also was the first U.S. spaceflight in which astronauts performed experiments.Whites EVA was considerably smoother than that of the first-ever EVA.On March 18, 10 weeks before Whites spacewalk, Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov made the first spacewalk as part of the Voskhod 2 mission, according to the website for the European Space Agency.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, APRIL 17, 1970, APOLLO 13 ASTRONAUTS RETURN ALIVE, DEFY ODDS AFTER SPACE EXPLOSIONHe almost didnt make it back.Leonovs spacesuit expanded in space — so much so that he could not fit through the door back into the capsule after his 12 minutes outside the vehicle.Making a hair-raising decision, he opened a valve on the suit to let enough air escape for him to enter the airlock, said the European Space Agency.As for astronaut White, his time came to a sudden and tragic end less than two years after his historic spacewalk.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 20, 1927, CHARLES LINDBERGH DEPARTS FOR FIRST SOLO NONSTOP FLIGHT ACROSS ATLANTICWhite, along with fellow astronauts Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee, died on Jan. 27, 1967, when their cabin caught fire during a launch rehearsal test of the Apollo 1 mission.White was laid to rest at West Point Cemetery in New York with full military honors, said the National Air and Space Museums website.During his spacewalk, White experienced something other-worldly. He confided later to his friend, the Reverend Jackson Downey of First Methodist Church in Cocoa Beach, Florida, that out there alone in space, he’d sensed the presence of God, according to Christian website Crosswalk.com.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn 2015, on the 50th anniversary of his spacewalk, White was posthumously awarded NASAs Ambassador of Exploration Award.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERIn many ways, Ed’s spacewalk was the modern-day equivalent of Lewis and Clark’s portage across the Gates of the Mountains during exploration of the West. He had ventured into uncharted territory, said NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman in 2015 at the ceremony honoring White, according to the National Air and Space Museums site.That historical achievement is a big part of the reason why Mars is now within our sights, and we will continue to push EVA technological advancements as we move forward on our journey to Mars.;Right

The third-place car wins the race.Thats the way I see it. Its not like I went out there and took the lead away. But we were in position. One of our best-executed races so far this year with probably our best speed weve shown this year.The son of Team Penske president who won the 2022 Daytona 500 in his rookie season, Cindric entered the race 20th in the Cup standings and now has vaulted himself into the playoffs.Team executive vice president Walt Czarnecki said the team had not lost confidence in Cindric.He has not lost his desire, Czarencki said. This is a reaffirming situation, circumstance for him today. ... Weve never lost faith in Austin Cindric, I promise you.Takeaways after a race where following Cindric across the finish line were Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski, Tyler Reddick and Joey Logano.Cindric ValidationCindric didnt make the playoffs last year as he finished 24th in the standings and had just five top-10s after a rookie year in which he posted nine top-10s. The win Sunday was just his second top-10 of the season in a year where Team Penske struggled over the first few months.I dont want to find myself in a position to be okay with 10th and be, ‘OK, hey, I finished in the top 10, thats an awesome day. No, thats 10th, Cindric said. Thats good, thats a step forward, but its not where I want to be. Its not the level in which I prepare. Its not the level in which my team expects to perform.Thats not good enough to race and drive at Team Penske. I know that. No one has to tell me that. Theres no meeting that has to be set in place. I take that very personally.The victory marked the first points-race win for the organization in the 15 races this year. It looked like it would be Blaney over the final 15 laps until Blaney ran out of fuel.Going into the race today, I went to bed last night knowing Id be really, really disappointed if one of us didnt win, Cindric said. Im just happy that we were in position there when the 12 car [of Blaney] ran out, bring home a win because this team deserves it.I cant wait to see everybody back at the shop. Everyone has been super supportive, believing in me through good days and bad days.Bell, Blaney disappointmentThe two drivers who left flabbergasted they didnt win were Blaney and Bell.Blaney had no idea he was close on gas.Obviously, bummed for us — the nut shots keep coming here this past month, Blaney said. Hopefully it straightens itself out. Im proud of the effort. We have to figure out what happened there. We thought we had more fuel than we did.Bells team was not sure what exactly caused the engine to lose horsepower. Bell did say he didnt think his intense battle with Blaney to try to regain the lead was what led to the issue.I dont think the racing had anything at all to do with it, Bell said. It wasnt our day. No matter where we were, we were going to end up blowing up.Larson-Busch tangleAt the end of the second stage, Kyle Larson tried to pass on the inside of Kyle Busch, and both cars spun, with Busch ending up done for the day and leaving Larson a little wounded before he rallied to finish 10th.It looked like [Larson] got loose down the front straightaway into Turn 1, Busch said. He was on older tires and trying to get us for a spot. Im not sure what that single point would mean for him, but it certainly hurt us a lot.It took that point away, as well as the others that we would get for the stage and then also the rest of the day. Its very frustrating. We cant afford days like that.Larson felt Busch pinched him a little but felt it was just hard racing — Ive got nothing bad to say about Kyle.We were coming to the end of that stage, and I was little better than him and [I went to] side-draft him and barely touched his quarter panel, Larson said. Im guessing it ticked him off and he squeezed into me. ... I guess he took the air off of me and [we] spun.Bob Pockrass covers NASCAR for FOX Sports.

Follow these steps to prevent parasitic infection, CDC says;Eating undercooked meat from wild game animals can cause a rare illness known as trichinellosis, health officials have warned.Six cases of the parasitic disease were reported by multiple family members from Arizona, Minnesota and South Dakota.The family members shared a meal that included undercooked meat from a black bear, as reported in the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.KITCHEN DISASTERS INCLUDING STOVETOP FIRES AND SMELLY MICROWAVES: WHAT TO DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONGIt is critically important to remember to properly cook any raw meat, as inadequately undercooked meat has a potential for both trichinosis and other infectious illnesses , Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital on Long Island, New York, told Fox News Digital.Meat containing Trichinella worms may also cross-contaminate other food items , such as vegetables, that are cooked alongside it, the CDC warned.People who consume meat from wild game animals should be aware that adequate cooking is the only reliable way to kill the parasites that cause trichinellosis, which can be resistant to freezing, Shama Cash-Goldwasser, epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, told Fox News Digital.Experts shared a summary of the cases reported so far — plus, tips for preventing trichinellosis.How did the infection from bear meat happen?In early July 2022, a 29-year-old man, whose name was not shared, started to feel ill a few days after sharing a meal during a family reunion in South Dakota.HIGH LEVELS OF RESISTANT BACTERIA FOUND IN UNCOOKED MEATS AND RAW DOG FOOD: ‘RED FLAG’He was hospitalized after returning to Minnesota, complaining of fever, severe muscle aches and swelling around the eyes. Blood tests revealed high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that can indicate a worm infection .The man’s most recent meal had included kabobs made from the meat of a black bear, the report stated.The black bear was originally harvested by one of the family members in northern Saskatchewan, Canada, in May 2022 — then frozen in a home freezer for 45 days at an unknown temperature.The bear meat was then thawed, grilled with vegetables and served inadvertently rare, the report said.The man was treated with albendazole, an anti-parasitic medication . An antibody blood test confirmed he had trichinellosis.The CDC launched an investigation, finding that six people from the gathering — with their ages ranging from 12 to 62 — had symptoms consistent with trichinellosis.Adequate cooking is the only reliable way to kill the parasites that cause trichinellosis.Among the six people, four had consumed both the bear meat and vegetables, but two only ate the vegetables. Three were hospitalized , but all recovered.MEAT CONTAMINATED WITH E. COLI COULD CAUSE HALF A MILLION URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS EACH YEAR, STUDY FINDSThe CDC found live worms in the remaining bear meat.Approximately 1% to 24% of black bears in Canada and Alaska are infected with trichinellosis, per the report.What is trichinellosis?Trichinellosis is the disease caused by a parasitic worm called Trichinella, Scott Roberts, M.D., associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, told Fox News Digital.It is very rare in humans and associated with eating raw and undercooked meats, particularly pork and wild game.RAW DIET FOR DOGS IS TAKING OVER TIKTOK, BUT WHAT DOES YOUR VETERINARIAN THINK OF THE LATEST TREND?Some examples of wild game that may cause disease include wild boar, wildcat, fox, wolf, seal or walrus — but people can also get infected from homemade jerky and sausage, according to the CDC.There are approximately 10,000 cases worldwide every year, but only about 15 cases in the U.S. annually.The disease historically has been linked to eating uncooked pork, but a better understanding of proper food preparation has reduced those occurrences, Glatt noted.Current regulations around raising commercially farmed pigs have also helped to lower the risk of trichinellosis in the U.S., the CDC noted.Although infection is rare, it is possible after eating even a small amount of raw or undercooked meat, the agency warned.Symptoms of diseaseThe severity of symptoms depends on how much of the parasite is ingested, Roberts told Fox News Digital.After the contaminated meat is consumed, the stomach produces acid that causes larvae to be released, the CDC stated.These larvae then invade the small intestine, which may cause gastrointestinal symptoms .Wild game meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure safe consumption.After one week, the larvae travel in the bloodstream, sometimes making their way into the muscle — which can cause muscle pain, according to the CDC.Symptoms can range from none at all, to GI issues (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and muscle/joint pain, Roberts said.One hallmark symptom is swelling of the face, especially around the eyes, per the CDC.Occasionally, the worms may also travel to the heart, lungs or brain, which can lead to problems with coordination, cardiovascular issues or breathing issues.Most cases will not require treatment, but antiparasitic therapy can be given if symptoms are severe, Roberts said.Prevention is keyTo prevent trichinellosis, Cash-Goldwasser of the CDC recommends cooking wild game meat to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) and verifying the temperature with a meat thermometer.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Safe handling of raw meat, including separation of raw or undercooked meat and its juices from other foods, is also recommended to prevent cross-contamination, she told Fox News Digital.The agency also advises against sampling meat until it has been confirmed to be fully cooked — and recommends freezing pork less than six inches thick for 20 days at 5 degrees Fahrenheit.Some wild game animals are freeze-resistant, which means freezing may not effectively kill all worms.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSalting, drying, smoking or microwaving meat also does not effectively kill worms, per the CDC.People should always remember to wash their hands with soap and warm water before and after handling raw meat — and to clean meat grinders and all other kitchen items thoroughly after each use, the agency advised.;Right

The current record is June 6, which was set in 2010.Sacramento in California will also likely get above 100 degrees this week, with a forecast high temperature on Tuesday of 102 degrees, followed by 104 degrees on Wednesday.These temperatures constitute readings that will be 10-20 degrees above average for much of inland California and the Desert Southwest.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPHeat alerts issued for parts of 6 states in WestWith the potentially dangerous heat wave expected to build, the National Weather Service has placed more than 25 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and Texas under a heat alert.Parts of Northern and Central California and southern Nevada, including Las Vegas, are under Excessive Heat Warnings, while places such as Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona are under an Excessive Heat Watch.Computer forecast models show the worst of the heat wave will happen on Wednesday and Thursday but could linger into Friday and the upcoming weekend.HOW THE WEATHER YOU’RE ACCUSTOMED TO AFFECTS NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HEAT WARNINGS, ADVISORIESNational Weather Service meteorologists warn of heat-related illnesses for those who are not drinking plenty of fluids and do not have access to air conditioning.Additionally, overnight lows will not drop into a comfortable range, which will impose an additional burden on people and pets hoping to cool off after sunset.In many of the areas where daily records could be tied or broken, the National Weather Service’s HeatRisk map has labeled communities at a Level 3 or 4 out of 4 for impacts.The HeatRisk threat level takes into consideration the unusual nature of the heat, the duration of the extreme temperatures and potential health impacts.WHEN SECONDS MATTER: CHILDREN EXPERIENCE HEATSTROKE SYMPTOMS WITHIN MINUTES OF BEING IN A HOT CARAt a code red (Level 3) stage, heat affects anyone who is not adequately hydrated or those without access to cooling. This is a stage below a code magenta (Level 4).A Level 4 signifies extreme heat that is either rare or long in duration. Health systems can be impacted by an influx of patients with heat-related illnesses.Parts of the Las Vegas metro are in the extreme, Level 4 out of 4, risk zone on Thursday and Friday.;Right

The SPC said the hail appeared to be as long as a 16 oz Monster Nitro energy drink can.And while that report is jaw-dropping, it still doesn’t break the record for the largest hailstone in Texas history.That honor belongs to hail that measured 6.4 inches in diameter that fell in April 2021 in Hondo, Texas, west of San Antonio.There were other reports of large hail in other communities, including a report of 4.5-inch hail and 3-inch hail in Brisco County.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHERPossible tornado in Texas injuries US Border Patrol agentWhile many communities were experiencing giant hail from the storms over the weekend, others were clearing damage and debris after likely tornadoes, including one that injured a U.S. Border Patrol agent near the U.S.-Mexico border.According to Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland, emergency crews responded to the town of Sanderson after a likely tornado there on Sunday.In a Facebook post, Cleveland said a U.S. Border Patrol agent was injured when his house took a direct hit from the storm.He said everyone has been accounted for, and all roads have been cleared of debris.;Right

The previous record of 0.48 inches was set on June 2, 2001.Seattle averages about 1.45 inches of rain for the entire month of June.And farther south, more record rainfall totals were recorded.Portland picked up 0.69 inches of rain on Sunday, breaking its old record for that date of 0.67 inches on June 2, 2010.Other communities in Oregon, like Astoria and McMinnville, also saw record rainfall amounts on Sunday.Big shift to hot and dry pattern days later?But the winter throwback could take a radical shift into summer by the end of this week in the Northwest.LIFE-THREATENING TRIPLE-DIGIT HEAT ACROSS WEST COULD THREATEN LAS VEGAS EARLIEST 110-DEGREE DAY ON RECORDSome computer forecast models are suggesting a rapid change in the weather pattern, bringing in the potential for much hotter weather as a strong ridge of high pressure builds into the region.;Right

It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e 5, which did so from the near side in 2020.LAS VEGAS ALIENS TRY TO STAVE OFF PESKY HUMANS, EXPERT SAYS: WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?The moon program is part of a growing rivalry with the U.S. — still the leader in space exploration — and others, including Japan and India. China has put its own space station in orbit and regularly sends crews there.The emerging global power aims to put a person on the moon before 2030, which would make it the second nation after the United States to do so. America is planning to land astronauts on the moon again — for the first time in more than 50 years — though NASA pushed the target date back to 2026 earlier this year.U.S. efforts to use private-sector rockets to launch spacecraft have been repeatedly delayed. Last-minute computer trouble nixed the planned launch of Boeings first astronaut flight Saturday.Earlier Saturday, a Japanese billionaire called off his plan to orbit the moon because of uncertainty over the development of a mega rocket by SpaceX. NASA is planning to use the rocket to send its astronauts to the moon.In China’s current mission, the lander is to use a mechanical arm and a drill to gather up to 4.4 pounds of surface and underground material over about two days.An ascender atop the lander will then take the samples in a metal vacuum container back to another module that is orbiting the moon. The container will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the deserts of China’s Inner Mongolia region about June 25.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMissions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications.
