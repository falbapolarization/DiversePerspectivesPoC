When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon’s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who’d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.speaker 1 My mom said that they weren’t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.meribah knightBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.speaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.meribah knightBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon’s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn’t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.speaker 2 I didn’t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.meribah knightIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage.

First, he’s posted better results in Nippon Professional Baseball than any pitcher who’s ever signed in the majors. Second, he’s only 25, making him an appealing option for teams that are both looking to win right away in 2024 and toward a sustained window of competitiveness beyond next year.Yamamoto has won the last three Eiji Sawamura awards — Japan’s version of the Cy Young Award — and twice been named the Pacific League’s most valuable player.Yamamoto works with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches higher. His best secondary pitch is a splitter that dives off the table, and he utilizes an unorthodox grip on a tight curveball. Yamamoto has struck out opposing hitters about 50 percent more than the league average in Japan.A team signing Yamamoto will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.
6;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/23/us/trump-haley-south-carolina;Election Updates: After backlash to Alabama ruling, Trump says he supports I.V.F.;Former President Donald J. Trump often characterizes his presidential campaign as a battle for America’s future. But speaking at a Christian broadcast media convention in Nashville on Thursday, he wrapped that depiction within a stark good-versus-evil framework, portraying his political opponents as part of a “wicked” system.Mr. Trump also revived his claim that America’s “greatest threat is not from the outside of our country” but “from within,” language that drew alarm last year from experts who saw in it echoes of autocratic leaders.During Thursday’s speech at the National Religious Broadcasters convention in Nashville, Mr. Trump portrayed the threat as liberals — more specifically, a “radical left, corrupt political class” — whom he broadly cast as intrinsically bent on attacking Christianity.“Christians, they can’t afford to sit on the sidelines in this fight,” Mr. Trump said. He later added, without offering evidence, that liberals were persecuting Christians because “they know that our allegiance is not to them. Our allegiance is to our country, and our allegiance is to our creator.” (There are many Christians who are Democrats.)Before running for office, Mr. Trump made little show of being particularly religious, which he acknowledged early in his speech, and he does not often give faith-focused speeches on the trail. But evangelical voters in 2016 were drawn to his populist message and his pledges to appoint “pro-life” judges, and they have remained loyal to him.During his third run for office, Mr. Trump has often cast himself as a staunch defender of the Christian right. He also often boasts of his appointment of three justices to the Supreme Court who, in 2022, voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.On Thursday, he praised those justices — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — from the stage, calling them “great justices” and “great people.” (All three will be deciding on constitutional issues tied to Mr. Trump’s criminal cases and his election bid.)Mr. Trump has often appeared uncomfortable or unwilling to discuss abortion at length on the campaign trail. During his speech, he took credit for the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, without using the word “abortion” or mentioning the case by name.“I was able to bring this issue for the first time in 54 years back to the states,” Mr. Trump said, before falsely declaring that “on both sides, everybody agrees that’s where it should be.”Many voters did not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, a fact that became more evident after abortion rights emerged as a campaign issue that lifted Democrats in elections across the country in 2022 and 2023.Mr. Trump has avoided taking a clear position on restrictions to abortion in the wake of those elections, and his emphasis on states’ rights during Thursday’s speech is part of that pattern.He also did not address a recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos in test tubes should be considered children, a decision that cited anti-abortion language. The Biden campaign has criticized Mr. Trump’s silence on the issue.Mr. Trump has previously said Republicans must find a way to talk about the issue that does not threaten them at the ballot box, and he previously criticized a six-week abortion ban signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican and a former political rival, as a “terrible mistake.”But Mr. Trump has told advisers and allies that he likes the idea of a 16-week national abortion ban with three exceptions, in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother, The New York Times reported last week, citing two people with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump’s deliberations.On Thursday, he tied the issue to his legal troubles, criticizing the Justice Department for prosecuting six anti-abortion protesters who in 2021 obstructed a reproductive health clinic in Tennessee in violation of federal laws. They were convicted by a jury in the state last month, in a case that has been a flashpoint for conservative activists.He also repeated a vow to create a federal task force to focus on “anti-Christian” bias. Mr. Trump has tried to appeal to Christian voters by accusing the Biden administration of criminalizing Americans for their faith, though experts have said that many of his claims are baseless or misleading.But Mr. Trump — who faces 91 felony counts in four criminal cases, including one tied to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election — uses those characterizations to support a larger theme of his campaign: that President Biden and Democrats are severe threats to democracy.Image Attendees in Nashville on Thursday. Evangelical voters have remained loyal to Mr. Trump. Credit... Taylor Baucom for The New York TimesThat tendency was on display on Thursday. Before Mr. Trump was introduced, loudspeakers sounded out “Justice for All,” a song featuring the J6 Prison Choir, which is composed of men who were imprisoned for their parts in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.That song — which features the men singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” while Mr. Trump recites the Pledge of Allegiance — is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump and his supporters to reframe the effort to overturn the 2020 election as an act of patriotism.During his speech, Mr. Trump referred to the singers as “the J6 hostages,” a term he has repeatedly used to describe those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6 attack.
7;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/23/world/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news;Middle East Crisis Netanyahu Pushes for Indefinite Military Control Over Gaza;Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said the United States considers the building of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories illegal and “counterproductive to reaching an enduring peace.”On settlements, we’ve seen the reports and I have to say we’re disappointed in the announcement. It’s been longstanding U.S. policy under Republican and Democratic administrations alike that new settlements are counterproductive to reaching an enduring peace. They’re also inconsistent with international law. Our administration maintains a firm opposition to settlement expansion, and in our judgment. this only weakens — doesn’t strengthen — Israel’s security.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the American government now considers new Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories to be “inconsistent with international law,” marking a reversal of a policy set under the Trump administration and a return to a decades-long U.S. position on the contentious subject.Mr. Blinken spoke at a news conference in Buenos Aires, after Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, made an announcement on Thursday indicating thousands of new residences would be added to settlements. Mr. Blinken said he was “disappointed” at the announcement.“It’s been longstanding U.S. policy under Republican and Democratic administrations alike that new settlements are counterproductive to reaching enduring peace,” he said. “They’re inconsistent with international law. Our administration maintains firm opposition to settlement expansion. And in our judgment, this only weakens — it doesn’t strengthen — Israel’s security.”Mr. Blinken was in Argentina for meetings with the recently elected president, Javier Milei, and the foreign minister, Diana Mondino.In Washington, John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, reiterated that stance in comments to reporters. “This is a position that has been consistent over a range of Republican and Democratic administrations — if there’s an administration that is being inconsistent, it was the previous one,” he said.State Department officials declined to say what actions, if any, the United States might take to hold Israeli settlers or the government legally accountable for the building of new settlements.Over many years, settlements have proliferated across the West Bank, Palestinian territory that is occupied by Israel, without the United States pushing for any legal action. About 500,000 residents now live in the occupied West Bank and more than 200,000 in East Jerusalem.In November 2019, President Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reversed four decades of U.S. policy by saying that settlements did not violate international law. State Department lawyers never issued a new legal determination that buttressed that policy change, and Mr. Blinken’s shift back to the old policy is consistent with a longstanding legal finding of the department.Starting in 2021, when President Biden took office, diplomatic reporters asked State Department officials whether Mr. Blinken planned to reverse Mr. Pompeo’s move, but the officials each time said there was no change to policy.Some State Department officials had grown uneasy last year over the sharp surge in acts of violence by extremist settlers. After the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, violence increased in the West Bank, and Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken began denouncing the actions and the expansion of settlements.On Friday afternoon, Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal Jewish American advocacy group that tries to shape policy on Israel, praised Mr. Blinken’s announcement.“Now, the administration must make clear that, particularly in light of the volatility of the current situation between Israelis and Palestinians, there must be no further expansion of the settlement enterprise,” he said in a statement. He added that the Biden administration should show it “will take further steps to enforce its view — and the view of the international community — that the creeping annexation of the West Bank must stop.”Mr. Pompeo’s move in 2019 bolstered the position of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who had vowed during two elections that year to annex the West Bank. Mr. Netanyahu’s new ruling coalition has several far-right ministers that support that direction, and it is those politicians who have helped Mr. Netanyahu stay in power despite the widespread criticism of him over his inability to protect Israel from the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas and his moves to undermine the judiciary’s power.On Thursday night, the office of one of those ministers, Mr. Smotrich, announced that an existing Israeli planning committee that oversees construction in the West Bank would be convened.He said the committee would move ahead with plans for more than 3,000 housing units, most of them in Ma’ale Adumim, near the site of a Palestinian shooting attack earlier that same day. Mr. Smotrich’s office described the expansion of the settlement as an “appropriate Zionist response” to the attack.“Let every terrorist plotting to harm us know that raising a hand against the citizens of Israel will be met with death, destruction, and the deepening of our eternal grip on the entire Land of Israel,” Mr. Smotrich said in a statement.Mr. Smotrich’s office did not say when the committee would be convened, whether the housing units would be new homes or what stage of the planning process they were in.Mr. Blinken also said he would withhold judgment on the postwar plan for Gaza that Mr. Netanyahu had begun to circulate among Israeli officials. Mr. Blinken said any plan has to align with three principles: Gaza should not be a base for terrorism, the Israeli government should not reoccupy Gaza, and the size of Gaza’s territory should not be reduced.“There are certain basic principles that we set out many months ago,” he said, referring to the outcome of a diplomatic conclave in Tokyo, “that we feel are very important when it comes to Gaza’s future.”Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Wade and paved the way for politicians to dictate some of the most personal decisions families can make.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as President Biden traveled to California, Ms. Jean-Pierre reiterated the Biden administration’s call for Congress to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law.
11;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/health/ivf-frozen-embryos.html;Alabama Says Embryos in a Lab Are Children. What Are the Implications?;The Alabama Supreme Court has opened a new front in the legal debate over when human life begins. Embryos created and stored in a medical facility must be considered children under the state’s law governing harmful death, the court ruled.Friday’s ruling was cheered by anti-abortion activists nationwide, who have long argued that life begins at conception. They were thrilled that, for the first time, a court included conception outside the uterus in that definition. But the strongest and most immediate effect of the decision will be on fertility patients trying to get pregnant, not women seeking to end their pregnancies.The Alabama ruling invites states to enact strict new regulations over the fertility industry that could sharply limit the number of embryos created during a cycle of medical treatment and affect the future of millions of stored frozen embryos. A concurring opinion even offered road maps for such statutes. That could have a chilling effect on a person seeking to have children through in vitro fertilization, whether single or part of a same-sex or heterosexual couple.What did the ruling say?The ruling is actually somewhat narrow. It applies to three couples who had sued the Center for Reproductive Medicine, a fertility clinic in Mobile, for inadvertently destroying their embryos. The plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to punitive damages under Alabama’s 1872 Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. Two lower state courts disagreed, saying the embryos were neither people nor children. The State Supreme Court reversed those rulings, saying that the embryos fell squarely under Alabama’s definition of minors and that the negligence lawsuits could proceed. The case will now go back to the State District Court for further litigation.
12;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/health/fertility-clinics-embryos-alabama.html;Accidents, Lax Rules and Abortion Laws Now Imperil Fertility Industry;To the fertility patients whose embryos were destroyed at an Alabama clinic, the circumstances must have been shocking. Somehow, a patient in the hospital housing the clinic had wandered into a storage room, pulled the embryos from a tank of liquid nitrogen, and then dropped them on the floor — probably because the tank was kept at minus 360 degrees.The bizarre episode was at the center of lawsuits filed by three families that eventually reached the Alabama Supreme Court. On Friday, a panel of judges ruled that the embryos destroyed at the clinic should be considered children under state law, a decision that sent shock waves through the fertility industry and raised urgent questions about how treatments could possibly proceed in the state.Yet the accident in the Alabama clinic echoes a pattern of serious errors that happen all too frequently during fertility treatment, a rapidly growing industry with little government oversight, experts say. From January 2009 through April 2019, patients brought more than 130 lawsuits over destroyed embryos, including cases where embryos were lost, mishandled or stored in freezer tanks that broke down.Those errors have taken on new gravity as the anti-abortion movement aims to extend “personhood” to fetuses and embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization, arguing that they are “unborn children” and bringing cases to an increasingly polarized judiciary open to considering the idea.
13;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/us/politics/alabama-ivf-court-republicans-democrats-election.html;Alabama I.V.F. Ruling Opens New Front in Election-Year Abortion Battles;An Alabama Supreme Court ruling, that frozen embryos should be considered children, has created a new political nightmare for Republicans nationally, who distanced themselves from a fringe view about reproductive health that threatened to drive away voters in November.Several Republican governors and lawmakers swiftly disavowed the decision, made by a Republican-majority court, expressing support for in vitro fertilization treatments. Some spoke out about their personal experiences with infertility. Others declared they would not support federal restrictions on I.V.F., drawing a distinction between their support for broadly popular fertility treatments and their opposition to abortion.“The concern for years has been that I.V.F. would be taken away from women everywhere,” Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina, said in an interview on Thursday. “We need to do everything we can to protect women’s access in every state to I.V.F.”Yet, even as some Republicans backed away from the court decision, Republican legislators in conservative states planned efforts to push bills that would declare that life begins at conception — a policy that could have severe consequences for fertility treatments.
14;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/us/politics/alabama-ivf-treatment-law.html;Alabama Lawmakers Move to Protect I.V.F. Treatments;Alabama lawmakers are considering legislation that would protect in vitro fertilization, after a State Supreme Court ruling last week led some clinics to halt I.V.F. treatments and left many women in limbo.The ruling, which declared that frozen embryos should be legally considered children, set off a scramble among leaders in both parties to preserve access to a crucial reproductive treatment for families who have struggled with infertility and for L.G.B.T.Q. couples who are seeking to have children.The court’s ruling, handed down by an 8-to-1 majority, applies only to three couples who were suing a fertility clinic over the accidental destruction of their embryos. But its wording — paired with a fiery opinion from the chief justice encouraging lawmakers to push its scope further — has left many wondering about the possible wider implications for people seeking I.V.F. treatment.At least three major fertility clinics in Alabama have halted I.V.F. treatments this week as doctors and lawyers assess the possible consequences of the ruling. On Friday, a major embryo shipping company said that it also was “pausing” its business in Alabama.
15;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/health/embryo-shipping-alabama-ivf.html;Major Embryo Shipping Company Halts Business in Alabama;Cryoport, a major embryo shipping company, said on Friday that it was “pausing” its business in Alabama as it evaluated the state’s Supreme Court decision that declared frozen embryos created through in vitro fertilization to be children.“Until the company has further clarity on the decision and what it means for Cryoport, clinics and intended parents, it is pausing all activity in Alabama until further notice,” read an email received by an Alabama fertility clinic and shared with The New York Times.The email said that Cryoport would “not be able to assist” with a scheduled shipment, and instead would offer a refund.The Alabama court’s ruling has already significantly limited fertility treatment for patients in that state. Three clinics have paused care as they evaluate what the ruling means for their patients and their own legal liability. The case involved several couples whose frozen embryos were accidentally destroyed at a clinic in Mobile. It found that clinics could be held liable for wrongful death claims, bringing new gravity to accidents that are not uncommon in fertility treatment.

[PHONE RINGING]amyThis is Amy.astead herndonHi. Thank you so much for picking up and for, more importantly, sending in a question to us. Can you first just tell me the question that you sent in to the show?amyYeah, so the thing I wanted to know, given the age of the presumed candidates, what does happen if one or both of these candidates dies before the election? I know that sounds harsh, but statistically speaking, it’s possible. And then what?astead herndonI guess, like, when did this question get on your radar? I know that’s a weird way to ask.amyOh, that’s a good question. I think because probably, like a lot of other people, this sounds weird, but just looking for a way out of this. And obviously by no unnatural ending, I don’t want that to happen to anyone. But I just thought is there any circumstance where it’s just not Trump-Biden again? Just what is every possibility of what could happen to set this up any differently whatsoever?astead herndonAmy is not alone. For the past few months, we’ve been asking our listeners to send in questions. And as November gets closer, there’s an increasing sense of desperation reflected in these questions. You’re asking about third party candidates, health emergencies, criminal convictions, death, things that could alter the inevitable rematch. It kind of feels like, as a country, we all fell asleep on the train, and now the conductor is announcing that you have to get off at the last stop, that you have no other choice but this one. And you have this moment of panic. You’re like, this is it? This is my only option? So today, we take on your two biggest 2024 questions. What if something happens to Biden or Trump? And is anyone else coming? From “The New York Times,” I’m Astead Herndon. This is “The Run Up.” [MUSIC PLAYING] Yo, what’s up?reid epsteinYou’re wearing a tie?astead herndonJust for you.reid epsteinDo I need to go change?astead herndonNo, I did CNN this morning. To start, we turned to some highly qualified friends.reid epsteinMy name is Reed Epstein, and I cover Joe Biden’s re-election campaign and the broader Democratic universe for “The New York Times.”astead herndonIn the time since Amy sent in her question, the age issue had only gotten more real. Scrutiny of President Biden’s age intensified after a recent special counsel report described him as quote, “An elderly man with a poor memory.” I wondered how, in your work reporting on the Biden campaign and the broader Democratic Party, how did that report land in Biden world, and what’s the campaign’s response been?reid epsteinIt landed like a ton of bricks. Think of like the old “Far Side” cartoons where an anvil would drop from a tree on somebody, and it was kind of like that.astead herndonI’m glad I got that. I was worried where that would go.reid epsteinThey were furious at the inclusion of the broadsides against the president’s memory, which they universally felt were out of bounds from his assignment to determine whether charges should be brought against the president on the documents retention issue. And they were also mad at the coverage of the special counsel’s report. We saw in the immediate aftermath, the campaign blasted reporters with the number of stories written about Biden’s age compared to stories about Donald Trump. They were clearly taking this as a license to go to war, not just with the Attorney General’s office, which they did, but also the media for covering what the special counsel said.astead herndonAs this kind of news cycle on age was developing, I totally see how the Biden campaign can make this argument. They made those arguments to us directly when we went to Wilmington, kind of saying that the concerns about Joe Biden’s age were overblown in a kind of insidery conversation I remember them framing it at the time, rather than the ways that people are actually going to experience the election. But like there are voters who are concerned, like the caller who sent in this question. What is the campaign doing about the legitimate voter issue regarding age looking ahead to the summer and the fall?reid epsteinWell, I think you’re right. Do not have to ask voters about Joe Biden’s age. I ask a lot of open ended questions to people I talk to. And it usually starts with, what do you think of Joe Biden? And inevitably, as you have heard, too —astead herndonThey say he’s old.reid epsteinThe answer is he’s so old I can’t believe he’s running again. I mean, I will tell you this. I was on vacation last year in Morocco, and we were in a car being led by a tour guide to the Sahara desert. And in that place, the guy asked — we were talking about — he was asking us what we do for a living. And I told him I’m a reporter, and he said, “Of all the people in America, is there no one younger than 80 years old who can run for president?astead herndonYeah.reid epsteinAnd so this is truly a global concern that people have about him. And so I don’t believe that the media is overplaying the issue and concern that voters have with Joe Biden’s age. I do think that — and we do know that the campaign is trying to reframe the age question every day into a choice question between a return to Trump or Joe Biden and not a referendum on Joe Biden. In part, because we have seen in polling for years at this point, that a referendum on Joe Biden alone, the president would almost certainly lose. And so part of that is them pushing stories about Trump being old, too. And when Trump said that Nikki Haley was in charge of security on January 6 when he met Nancy Pelosi, like they pushed that on their social media platforms. And they pushed that out to reporters, and they tried to make that into a news cycle about Trump’s forgetfulness and his predilection for getting things wrong while speaking to rallies. And they’re right that he does do that, and he’s 77 years old. He’s gotten a lot of things wrong as well, but the fact of the matter is voters receive Trump and Biden differently when it comes to their age and their acuity. And while Trump is also slipping, quite publicly, that has not baked in for voters in the same way that it has been for Biden.astead herndonI mean, but that description of what you’re saying the campaign’s plan is, which is to reframe the age question into a choice question, it doesn’t actually go at the heart of what voters think about the president, right? Like is there any plans to put him out there more? Is there any plans to have him talk? I was with someone yesterday who says that he should call his economic plan like grandpa economics and kind of embrace the older person kind of mantra. I guess I’m wondering, is there any plans to legitimately reframe him on his age rather than just say Donald Trump is also old?reid epsteinI mean, they’ve gotten a lot of advice along the grandpa economics lines. I’ve talked with advisors to the campaign, donors to the campaign, other Democratic elected officials, and many of them have offered unsolicited advice, both directly to the campaign and through the press to the campaign, about how the president should lean into his age as a way to answer that question. They have not done that, in part because the president doesn’t want to. Like he doesn’t want the age to be an issue. And so they haven’t done it aside from he will make jokes about when he was with the founding fathers. But they don’t engage in a serious way, the way that some of their allies would like them to. And that has led to the scenario that we’ve been talking about where voters are concerned about his age and acuity, and they don’t do a whole lot to answer those questions.astead herndonI want to really focus on the heart of the question Amy asked us, though. Does the Democratic Party have a plan if, for whatever reason, Biden became unable to run? Does a Plan B exist somewhere in some secret lock vault?reid epsteinSo there is no Plan B. It is — Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee unless one of two things happens. Either there is a major health calamity that he suffers between now and November, or Joe Biden himself decides that he’s not going to run. And for the first thing, we all hope that the president remains in good health. He appears to be in good health.astead herndonYeah, there’s no wish — we’re not wishcasting.reid epsteinThere’s no reason to believe that his health is deteriorating. He seems to be — he rides his bike. He rides the Peloton. He is a very healthy 81-year-old man. There’s also no reason to believe that he’s going to wake up one day and decide this is not for him. Like, the man has wanted to be president of the United States for most of his adult life. He first started seriously considering running for president in 1984. He ran for president three times. He has raised already more than $200 million in this campaign for re-election. There’s no reason to think that he is going to change his mind.astead herndonLet’s slow this down, though. The only two things that could derail what seems like the inevitable path of Joe Biden becoming the Democratic nominee would be a major health scare that would cause him to be unable to run.reid epsteinYeah, that’s right. This would be a really serious, calamitous health episode.astead herndonI mean, Bernie Sanders had a heart attack in the 2020 election and took a couple of weeks off the trail, if I remember correctly. Of course, there was the situation with Senator John Fetterman as he was running, but you’re saying it would have to be something that would completely shift his ability to go out on the campaign trail or do his duties as president.reid epsteinIt would have to be worse than those episodes, I would think.astead herndonThe other option is for him to decide independently that he would not want to run anymore. Let’s say Joe Biden were to say, in two months, I want to step down. What would even be the process? Like what would even have to happen? Would it automatically go to the vice president? Like, I actually don’t know what would happen.reid epsteinSo I had to make some calls on this.astead herndonNice, thank you for doing that.reid epsteinWhen you all told me that I had to answer this question, I didn’t know, either. So there’s two different scenarios, and it depends on when either a decision would be made or an episode happened. If it was before the Democratic Convention in August, the delegates to the convention would choose both the president and the vice president if there was a vacancy. It would be a free-for-all at the convention. And based on what we know generally of the makeup of who those delegates typically are, it would be hard to imagine a scenario where it didn’t go to Kamala Harris just because —astead herndonThose are party people. Those are people who —reid epsteinParty people, the biggest caucus is women. The second biggest caucus is African-Americans, and those are two groups that are generally pretty loyal to the vice president. And also like in a scenario where Biden is not the nominee anymore and there is chaos at the convention, you have to wonder like what Democrats are going to step up and challenge the vice president in that scenario.astead herndonFurther adding to the chaos.reid epsteinFurther adding to the chaos. She could be in some of these scenarios. She could be the president at that point, and then you’d be challenging a sitting president and not the vice president. That’s a very steep political lift for anybody in that type of chaotic environment. The second scenario is something happens with Biden after the convention. There’s no precedent for this. But the Democratic National Committee chair, who is Jaime Harrison, would confer with the Democratic leadership in Congress and the leadership of the Democratic Governors Association.astead herndonWow.reid epsteinAnd that group would then basically be authorized to fill vacancies on the national ticket with some conferring with the broader DNC membership, which is about 440-some people.astead herndonWow.reid epsteinAnd again, this is a scenario where it would be like virtually impossible for them to pick anybody but the vice president to fill that spot based on what we know of those groups.astead herndonOne, I so appreciate you doing this kind of reporting because I have not thought about these scenarios. But there’s a couple things that jump out to me. In both of those situations, either before the convention or after, this becomes an elite process. The leadership of the Democratic Party, whether at the DNC or at the Congressional level or the gubernatorial level, would essentially get the power to choose who replaces Biden. Correct?reid epsteinThat’s right. That’s the way it would work.astead herndonAnd importantly, because of that, because of the who the people are who would then be making the selection and their investment in the top levels of the Democratic Party, it becomes very difficult to see this becoming a situation that would lead to someone outside of the vice president.reid epsteinIt just is a very difficult scenario to figure out how it would be anybody else, assuming that she wants it, which there’s no reason to believe that she wouldn’t want it. You talk to Democrats, and people say, what about Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or any of the people who ran for president in 2020? And it’s just it’s hard to fathom a scenario where anybody in that crew of Democrats could muster the sort of organization and fundraising, essentially on a moment’s notice, to compete in a serious way with the vice president.astead herndonRight. I mean, it’s interesting because on one hand, this is really expected. That is the reason the job of vice president exists. But at the same time, it’s super interesting to me that because of the unprecedented nature of this scenario, and because it would only come up in a moment of chaos — like inherently, if Joe Biden is not going to be the person on the ballot in November, or if something were to come up that were to trigger some of these scenarios, it would inherently be a chaotic moment for the party. That it does seem as if the only answer to what happens after that is more chaos. Like it doesn’t seem — like even if they were to hand it over to the vice president, I can’t imagine that being a thing that happens really swimmingly. To answer Amy’s question of is there something that very neatly takes Joe Biden off of the path of being the Democratic nominee? The answer to me, from what you’re telling me, seems to be no. The only reason that can happen is mess.reid epsteinIf — yeah, if, I mean, an alien abduction, anything that took Joe Biden off the stage would be immensely chaotic and — for the political system and the American government in general. And it’s, frankly, a situation that we’ve never seen before. You have to go back to 1968 when Lyndon Johnson decided after the New Hampshire primary to get out, but that was much earlier. It was later in the calendar than we are now, but it was much earlier in the process of nominating a president than what — where the Democrats are at this point. And everybody remembers that 1968 ended with riots at the Democratic party convention —astead herndonAlso in Chicago.reid epsteinAnd also in Chicago.astead herndonWhere we’ll be this year.reid epsteinAnd a victory for Richard Nixon in part because of chaos that was — sort of engulfed the Democratic Party in that cycle.astead herndonYeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you, Reid, for your time.reid epsteinThanks, Astead.astead herndonCut. [MUSIC PLAYING] Are we still in here? Are we — when is Maggie [INAUDIBLE]? Next up, someone to field our questions about Trump, who himself is 77 and is appearing to coast in the Republican primary after winning contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. He’s also favored in this weekend’s South Carolina Republican Primary, as he’s polling well ahead of Nikki Haley, the state’s former governor. Hey, Maggie. How are you?maggie habermanHi, Astead.astead herndonNaturally, I called Maggie Haberman. How’s it going?maggie habermanThis has been a crazy morning because of these hearings.astead herndonYeah, I’m sure.maggie habermanHang on, let me just — all right, we’re good.astead herndonWe just talked to Reid Epstein, our colleague, about Biden’s age and if there was anything that could happen that can kind of change the course of his kind of path to the nomination in November. And he said there was two things. One is a big enough health event, and two would be something that would cause him to wake up one morning and decide that he doesn’t want to run anymore. But both are very unlikely scenarios. Now, we know that Donald Trump is also of advanced age. I guess I wanted to pose the same question to you. Is there anything that comes up in the kind of Plan B category that could mean that Donald Trump wasn’t the Republican nominee or that the campaign wouldn’t kind of continue its inevitable march to the conventions in November?maggie habermanIt’s a really good question. So, Astead, thinking about what Reid said about does Biden wake up one day and decide not to go forward? The chances of that happening for Donald Trump are close to zero, if not greater than zero, less — whatever negative integer you want to use. The campaign is so intertwined with his fight for staying out of jail, given that he has been indicted four times and is now facing a certain trial starting at the end of March in Manhattan. So that comes off the table. In terms of whether there would be a health event, that’s not an impossible thought. He is somebody who, when he was president, we know from the White House doctors he had a form of heart disease. It’s unlikely that that has changed dramatically in a positive direction. We don’t know what his health is like now, but I do know that at the end of 2022, when they were looking ahead to a campaign that he was about to run, there was private discussion about not holding too many events in part because he’s old. And they didn’t want to cause him damage by running him into the ground. And I do think that that’s part of why we have seen less of him. I think there’s other reasons, too, like it saves them money not putting on events and so forth. But his age is a factor. That having been said, it would have to be a catastrophic event to keep him from running. If it was something mild or something light, I think he would try to push forward, and I’m not sure we would even know it was happening.astead herndonWell, let’s try to separate these two things. The first thing you said is that because of the kind of legal questions swirling around him and the fact that his political campaign is, frankly, his response for those things, that that kind of decreases the likelihood that he would ever kind of voluntarily step out of the race. We’re talking to you on the day when those things are jumping off. As you said, there was just a trial set for his criminal case in New York. I guess I wanted to just underscore that. Part of the reason you’re saying that there is — not — there is very little likelihood, next to zero, that Trump would voluntarily step out of the race, is because he needs the campaign as an answer to his legal troubles.maggie habermanCorrect, and as an answer to his legal troubles both in terms of a shield during the cases. Remember, he has claimed presidential immunity, although that’s been struck down by an appeals court and is likely to go to the Supreme Court now In the January 6 federal trial. But in Manhattan where he’s facing trial at the end of March, and this is related to hush money payments to a porn star in 2016 and in Georgia where it’s related to his efforts to subvert the transfer of power that he’s been charged, he is claiming pieces related either to his duties in office. In Georgia or in Manhattan, this is being done to distract from my successful Republican presidential primary campaign. And I shouldn’t have to face this trial because we’re in the middle of campaign season and so forth and so on. So the presidential campaign has become a set piece.astead herndonGot it. Yeah, and so that makes a lot of sense. The second part you’re talking about, regarding his age, I do think it’s a kind of underrated point, the point about heart disease that you made, we learned when he was in office. And that just as we had spent a lot of talk about Biden’s kind of visible decline, there has been more instances of Donald Trump. I think about him confusing Nikki Haley for Nancy Pelosi in reference to who was running January 6 security. I mean, when you think about the question of Trump’s age, how do you think that is going to be a factor on the campaign’s mind heading into November? Reid used the term that the things that would trouble the Biden campaign is a health calamity. When you think about the Trump campaign, is it that similar standard when we think about what could cause them to kind of alter their direction?maggie habermanYeah, it is. I mean, I think that what you’re talking about specifically — that Nikki Haley, Nancy Pelosi moment — that was really, really pronounced. And so pronounced that Trump felt the need to try to clear it up at a rally in South Carolina this week. When he’s trying to rewrite the history of it and insist he really did it on purpose — which he clearly did not if you watch the tape — then you can see that he knows this is a problem, and that this is sinking in. But I do think it’s the same issue if — it would have to be something significant. And I would put it, actually, even in a separate category, which is a little different than Biden, because we don’t see an incumbent president or at least this incumbent president as often as you might see a challenger because challengers need to be out on the road more. Presidents are protected by the armor of the office —astead herndonDoing the job.maggie habermanAnd doing the job and don’t have to be seen as much and always seem to be busy, even if we don’t have visibility into that. In Trump’s case, I think it would have to be something that literally could not be hidden. It would have to be an extended hospital stay, or it would have to be something that happens on stage or in front of a crowd.astead herndonThat’s interesting. I mean, you’re kind of pointing to if they could keep it away from the public, they would if something were to happen under that kind of public standard.maggie habermanCorrect, and what I’m basing that on, Astead, is it’s not like we have no predicate for that with Trump. He was really, really sick with COVID, and they were, to put it mildly, less than candid about what was going on with his health. So I have no reason to believe it would be different this time.astead herndonYeah, I guess I wanted to ask you also about some things that came up in our conversation with one of our listeners. Does the Republican Party have a Plan B if it were not to be Trump, or if something were to happen? We asked this question also of Reid and Democrats.maggie habermanIt’s a good question, but I mean, I would — I don’t know what Reid’s answer was. But I would imagine it’s similar, which is there they. There is no party absent Trump. Trump is literally in the process of ousting his own hand-picked Republican Party chair to try to get another one who he thinks will focus more on his false claims of widespread election fraud. So there is no they. The process works this way. If something happens ahead of the convention, there would have to be a change in the rules. And it would have to be that the delegates process changes because Trump is the person leading delegates right now. And Nikki Haley wouldn’t necessarily get those by default just because she’s the person still actively campaigning. I think you would see a lot of other candidates who have suspended their candidacies suddenly start campaigning again, and then it would get decided at the convention.astead herndonJust because Nikki Haley is currently the other candidate still actively running would not inherently mean that if something were to happen to Trump, Nikki Haley becomes the nominee.maggie habermanCorrect. That is not how this works. If something were to happen after the convention, then the 168 members of the Republican National Committee would have to meet again and decide on what happens. And even then, Astead, it gets murky because depending on when something would happen, you could end up in a situation where it’s a write-in campaign in a lot of states because a lot of states will have printed their ballots already.astead herndonThat would already say Donald Trump.maggie habermanCorrect, and so it just gets — it gets hairy.astead herndonSo if something were to happen before the convention, then the delegates who formally nominate the party’s nominee would have to — there would have to be some rule change that allows for them to back somebody else, but that doesn’t inherently mean Nikki Haley. It could mean other people try to woo them, including the people who have previously dropped out of the race. If something were to happen after the convention, then the insiders of the Republican Party or the 168 members of the RNC would then have to select someone. But to your point, there’s not real clarity on any direction that would go. It sounds like either before convention or after, if something were to happen, it leads to enormous amounts of questions and somewhat inevitable chaos.maggie habermanIt is definitely going to be chaos. What level of chaos, we don’t know, but yes, it would be chaos.astead herndonSo to sum it up, in answer to our listener Amy’s question of if there’s anything that takes us off of this road of Biden-Trump — we asked kind of specifically in relation to age, health, and the legal concerns. We asked Reid on the Democratic side, and his answer was extremely unlikely that anything would take us off this road. I want to pose the same question to you. What is the likelihood that this ends in November with someone other than Donald Trump at this point?maggie habermanAs a Republican?astead herndonYes.maggie habermanExtremely unlikely, and can I add an asterisk to that?astead herndonYep.maggie habermanIt’s going to be a long asterisk. There is an episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” where Larry David is at a table, and somebody spills on the table. And his mother-in-law sits still and doesn’t move and says somebody get a sponge. And Larry David says, why don’t you get a sponge? And this sort of somebody get a sponge approach to Donald Trump, I mean, we hear this a lot about it won’t really be Donald Trump from including Republicans who don’t want to deal with him but also from Democrats who don’t want to deal with him anymore. And somebody get a sponge, somebody else take care of this has not been a solution. And so that extends to all manners of things that could happen to make him not the nominee. It is extremely, extremely unlikely that he will not be the nominee. It’s not impossible. Anything can happen, as we’ve seen.astead herndonYeah, no, I appreciate it I think about just talking to you and Reid back to back makes me think of just the interconnected nature of this like.maggie habermanOh, yeah.astead herndonLike, I’m not sure if it wasn’t Donald Trump that we would have Joe Biden, and I’m not sure if it wasn’t Joe Biden that we would have Donald Trump on this side. But they both seem to at least politically need each other in this one.maggie habermanI completely agree with you. And I think we’ve talked about this, but this race is going to feel a lot less like 2020, at least as it’s shaping up, than 2016, when it was two nominees with — who had — neither of whom had been president with high negatives. Now it’s a former president and an incumbent president, both with high negatives in an era where every president has bad approval ratings at this point because that’s just how voters are toward elected officials.astead herndonVoters have not given anybody high marks, but they’re giving these two people, especially low marks.maggie habermanThe national numbers are a unique situation. That is true. [MUSIC PLAYING]astead herndonThank you, Maggie. We really appreciate your time, as always.maggie habermanThank you. Thanks for having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]astead herndonOne more question after the break. [MUSIC PLAYING]anna foleyHey, Astead.astead herndonHey, Anna. What’s up?anna foleyNothing much, another beautiful day in the office.astead herndonAnother beautiful day in the office.anna foleySo I’ve been producing this episode, the question and answer, listeners reaching out, and I actually ended up talking to a listener who had a question, this guy named Elly. Hello?ellyHello.anna foleyThis is Anna from “The New York Times.”ellyHi, this is Elly.anna foleyHi, Elly. How are you doing?ellyI’m doing well.anna foleyAnd his question was kind of in line with the broad beam that we’ve been talking about. What could possibly happen that would rock us off the course that we’re barreling towards? So far we’ve talked about what’s happening within the parties, like what’s happening with these candidates — party infighting and bylaws and all that sort of thing. His question was more about outside forces that can make a difference in this race.ellyI wrote a question asking, basically, how voters and different people in more critical positions are thinking about third party candidates. There’s — I mean, primarily around RFK. I’m a big supporter of RFK.anna foleyOh, you are.ellyYeah. I’m a big supporter of RFK, have been since beginning of this summer.anna foleyBasically, Elly’s question was, what about all the people who aren’t Trump or Biden who are or might get in this race? Because he doesn’t see what he believes represented in either the Democratic or the Republican Party.ellyI, in general, have a philosophy of positive politics and not negative politics. I try to resist the urge of doomsday politicking, like you have to vote for this person or the world’s going to end because that just incentivizes negative politics. And I want to try to find candidates who I actually support for what they’re saying, even if I don’t support everything they’re saying. So like, yeah, if RFK wasn’t in the race, I probably would have been supportive of maybe Cornel West. Maybe I would have looked for someone in the Green Party or Libertarian Party.anna foleyIt’s very much a question in line with what we’ve been talking about this whole episode, right? People want to know is there anyone else coming? Could anybody spoil the match between Trump and Biden? Like how would all of that even play out? And so when I was thinking about all of that, I realized that there’s actually quite a few candidates or people in this bucket of potential third party, potential independents, and it’s been a while since we’ve talked about them on the show. So what I was hoping to do to help this listener with his question is to do a lightning round update, basically where each of these candidates are and what challenges they face.astead herndonYeah that sounds great. Am I the — I’m the lightning round answerer.anna foleyYeah, I didn’t mean for this to feel like a pop quiz, but now I’m realizing it kind of feels like a pop quiz.astead herndonIt definitely feels like a pop quiz.anna foleyI’m so sorry. Did you like pop quizzes? That’s a crazy question.astead herndonWe both know I did not like pop quizzes. Now, you and me both know. I was a mid student. The representation Joe Biden gives is for the real C students of America, and so I didn’t like quizzes of any form, told before or pop.anna foleyAnd I got a little crafty with all of the candidates. And so I made something.astead herndonOh my. Oh, this is a wheel.anna foleyYeah.astead herndonA Wheel of Fortune wheel.anna foleyYes, with all of the people that I could come up with. And so I figured we could spin it, and you could give an update.astead herndonGot it. This is so cute. I like this.anna foleyOK, good. [WHEEL SPINNING]astead herndonOh, that’s — oh, God. I’m sorry. This is so funny. It has little like —anna foleyConfetti.astead herndonConfetti. Cornel West.anna foleyYeah, what’s up with him?astead herndonWell, Cornel West is a pretty famous Black Studies professor who has taught at the Harvards and the Yales.cornel westWe need you to be part and parcel of wrestling with this corporate duopoly, this two party system that impedes. It gets in the way of the unleashing of the kind of policies of abolishing poverty and homelessness, of dealing with working —astead herndonHe announced a Green Party presidential run last year. But then after receiving some criticism, he got off of the Green Party ticket and is now trying to start his own party, which is called a Justice for All party. The problem is — and I think this is going to be an issue that comes up with several of these people — is when you’re not in one of the major parties, it’s a lot harder to get ballot access.anna foleyWhen you say ballot access, are you talking — you’re talking general, right?astead herndonYeah, I’m talking about in November will their name appear as an option for people to vote for? So obviously, that’s step number one to actually have a tangible impact on the race. So Cornel West is in the position where I’m pretty sure he’s only kind of at this point focused on Florida. I think there’s an intent to focus on North Carolina, but for the purposes of like will this be a person who affects the November race, I would say at this point, that’s looking unlikely because of the real ballot challenges. But as always with third party candidates, they can push issues to the top. They can push sentiments to the forefront that go beyond their importance of actual votes. So I do think Cornel West is someone who could highlight Biden’s potential struggles with Black voters. He’s someone who can highlight, particularly the war in Gaza and the progressive kind of leftist group who is really upset with Biden. And I think that is a candidacy that threatens to stoke some of those concerns, but its Cornel West going to be on the ballot in all 50 states? It’s not looking likely. [WHEEL SPINNING]anna foleyJill Stein.astead herndonJill Stein. Well, this is helpful because Jill Stein has taken the place that Cornel West left on the Green Party.jill steinDemocrats have betrayed their promises for working people, youth, and the climate again and again while Republicans don’t even make such promises in the first place. And both parties are a danger to our democracy, expanding —astead herndonUnlike some of the other candidates we’re going to talk about, ballot access is not Stein’s biggest problem because she is the Green Party candidate. And so she has ballot access in several states because the party already has access. Jill Stein threatens to play the same role she played in 2016 when she was on the ballot at that time. Now, remember, in that close election, there was a lot of talk about whether third party votes really pulled away from Hillary Clinton and helped spur the victory of Donald Trump. And while there’s some kind of evidence or data to that, I think that all of the one determining factors are overblown. It was a really close election in 2016. It was a really close election in 2020, and it threatens be a really close election in 2024. So in that reality, all of these other impacts matter. And certainly the possibility that some people could follow a trend from 2016 and maybe back a Green Party candidate over one of the two nominees could be possible. And I think for Jill Stein specifically, there will be a fear that she will pull from Joe Biden. But I would say on the scale of potency relative to other candidates, I have not heard the Biden campaign or someone involved in Democratic politics be particularly concerned about Jill Stein this time around. [WHEEL SPINNING] Well, this one’s easy.anna foleyMarianne Williamson.astead herndonMarianne Williamson has dropped out of the presidential race. I don’t know if that’s information that maybe has cut through, or if people even knew Marianne Williamson was running. But the candidate that went kind of viral in 2020 about being a kind of vibes-y chacras-y version of Democratic politics. She was running again last year as someone who was ostensibly trying to challenge Joe Biden in the Democratic nomination alongside Dean Phillips, the Congressman who’s also taken up that mantle. But as we’ve reported, there is very little appetite in the Democratic party to have a competitive primary and specifically not so for the two candidates who are trying to mount that. And so Williamson formally dropped out a couple of weeks ago and suspended her campaign. [WHEEL SPINNING]anna foleyRFK, Jr.astead herndonYeah, so this is a kind of tricky one. RFK, Jr is by far the most prominent non Trump-Biden candidate who has entered the 2024 race. Now, remember, originally RFK, Jr was running as a Democrat. So like Marianne Williamson, like Dean Phillips, he was in the Democratic primary and trying to run against Joe Biden. Several months ago, towards the end of last year, he dropped out of the Democratic race and announced that he would run as an independent. And that creates some possibility and some challenges. On the possibility side, as I was saying, running in the Democratic primary has not proved really successful for folks because you have to run in this kind of process that Joe Biden functionally controls through the DNC. And there hasn’t been real motivation from base Democrats to replace Joe Biden even if they express some satisfaction. What there has been is real kind of polling data that says that people want an option outside of Biden and Trump. And that is now where RFK, Jr is trying to position himself. As people remember, his Super PAC paid a lot of money to have a Super Bowl ad that was a carbon copy of an iconic Kennedy ad that JFK ran in the 60s and kind of updated it to say you should think about someone who was not a Democrat or Republican — [MUSIC PLAYING]archived recording 1 (SINGING) A man who’s old enough to know — archived recording 2 (SINGING) And young enough to do.astead herndon— who’s younger than these other candidates and is kind of pitching himself as the free thinking person’s candidate. If you look at polling, RFK is in a different category than the Williamsons or the Dean Phillips or the Jill Steins or Cornel Wests. Because of his name recognition, you can see sometimes 10 percent, 15 percent of voters, even upwards of that, say they will be interested in that candidacy. But I would also say that RFK would not just represent a challenge for Joe Biden. Donald Trump is usually the person who that type of Libertarian or cranky or doesn’t fit in a conspiratorial voter flows to, and that might not be the case if RFK is also on the ballot. And so that has created a lot of fear from top levels of both Democrats and Republicans, who think it’s not clear exactly who he would play spoiler for. That’s the first thing. Second thing is, like Cornel West, he also has ballot access problems. The benefit of running in a Democratic primary is, of course, if you were to beat Joe Biden and become the nominee, you’re on the ballot. Because he is now saying he’s running as an independent, he is currently engaged in a very expensive and difficult effort to get his name on the ballot and across the states. And that’s the real thorn in the candidacy side is the kind of logistical question of will they be able to get on the ballot? But if he can overcome the ballot access problem and become a legitimate candidate in this race, this is the person that will keep [? DNR ?] up at night. Because if you can combine name, money, and message, that’s the ingredients of a Ross Perot or someone who can take a third-party candidacy and really go far.anna foleyAll right,astead herndonLast one. Do we still spin the wheel or no?anna foleyI feel like for — to complete the wheel, we have to. [WHEEL SPINNING]astead herndonAll rightanna foleyNo Labels.astead herndonYeah, this is a literal follow up to the work we did last year, but No Labels is a non-partisan, independent political group in Washington, DC that has tried to brand itself as the organization that’s above partisanship and polarization, tries to encourage bipartisanship through lawmakers and both parties rejecting their extremes. In the last year, No Labels has made a very public effort to try to entice a candidate to run a third party campaign for president that they would support and help get on the ballot.anna foleyThey called it a unity ticket.astead herndonExactly. They called it a unity ticket, and the premise was that they were going to have one party at the top, a different party as vice president, and that that’s what Americans needed was a kind of joint ideological ticket. Now, I think it’s important to point out the differences between that and the kind of RFK. That’s talking about independence in terms of picking and choosing different ideological buckets but isn’t saying I’m strict right or left. What No Labels is talking about is having one Republican, one Democrat in a specific ticket that’s centered around unity. And so that was their premise. Now when we talked to No Labels, it was clear that they had not fully thought through how a unity ticket was the solution to polarization. And one of the things I really remember about that reporting is that it made clear that the kind of top-down, ideologically-driven premise that No Labels works in is not necessarily the language of people who hate both candidates. So when you ask, why do you hate both candidates? They might just say because they’re old. They might just say because they don’t like the system itself. It’s not clear that the type of candidates No Labels was pitching as the solution — the Joe Manchins, the Mitt Romneys, the Larry Hogans — are even people that these folks know or would be people they come to. So that’s important to say. Now, to update in the last year, No Labels has kind of had a tough go at it, partially because their entire strategy is premised on the idea of attracting a top tier candidate to join their ticket. Now, the person they have most tried to float is Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is the more centrist Democrat who has already announced that he won’t be running for re-election in November. He just said last week that he would not run as a third party candidate and close the door on the prospect of working with No Labels. Now, this was their top choice. This is someone who is doing a listening tour, talking about the need for bipartisanship, and is really the avatar for centrism in DC as a whole. But because of the low likelihood of success from a third party candidate and considering that Manchin is someone who does remain close to President Biden, it’s not particularly a surprise that he decided not to eventually join the No Labels ticket. But it does strike a big blow to the unity ticket that they wanted to project because their top candidate that they wanted to lead that has now bowed out. The other candidates they’ve talked about have also made different decisions. So Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland, who No Labels is trying to entice, he just announced that he was going to be running for Senate in Maryland. So that’s going to be a tough race, but more importantly, he’s not taking the presidential option. And the drop off between those type of candidates and who else they could get is so big that it’s really created a difficult position for No Labels to be in because if they don’t have a candidate to actualize a lot of that signing work, a lot of that ballot access work, it all kind of crumbles. So if you’re recognizing a theme here, it’s that our system makes it very difficult for these third party options to succeed. If you want to be president, the hardest thing to do is to try to do that without the Democratic or Republican parties. This unique situation, because of the distastefulness of candidates, has created a different space so the RFKs, so the other parties can garner more interest. And the closeness of our elections mean that that interest might really matter. But for the broader question, for the listener question of will these third party options mean that we don’t have Trump v Biden, I think that answer is clearly no. What they can do is complicate the calculus of how Trump versus Biden might play out or impact the type of issues they have to address. Or they could become a vessel for people to lodge their distaste. It would not surprise me if we end this year with the highest number of third party votes we’ve had in a long time, and that will certainly matter. But it is overwhelmingly likely, because of the way that our political process works, that the next president is either the Democratic or Republican nominee.anna foleyThank you.astead herndonThanks, Anna, appreciate it.

Ask the Tea Party.;When Nikki Haley ran for governor of South Carolina in 2010, one of her early campaign stops was the Aiken, S.C., living room of Claude and Sunny O’Donovan.Mr. O’Donovan, the co-founder of a local Tea Party group, had invited Ms. Haley and other candidates to make their case to the conservative activists of Aiken County, a heavily Republican enclave of golf courses and retirement communities. The crowd that gathered around the O’Donovans’ coffee table numbered only a couple of dozen. But the retired couple was smitten.“We fell in love with her,” Mr. O’Donovan, 85, said. “She was a dynamite gal.”A digital picture frame in the O’Donovans’ home still displays a photograph of Ms. Haley at the meeting. But on Feb. 24, when Ms. Haley faces Donald J. Trump in South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary, both of the O’Donovans plan to vote for Mr. Trump.“I think he has the values of the Tea Party,” Mrs. O’Donovan, 84, said. “It was for the people, and I see Trump as being for the people.”

Blinken said on Friday that the American government now considers new Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories to be “inconsistent with international law,” marking a reversal of a policy set under the Trump administration and a return to a decades-long U.S. position on the contentious subject.Mr. Blinken spoke at a news conference in Buenos Aires, after Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, made an announcement on Thursday indicating thousands of new residences would be added to settlements. Mr. Blinken said he was “disappointed” at the announcement.“It’s been longstanding U.S. policy under Republican and Democratic administrations alike that new settlements are counterproductive to reaching enduring peace,” he said. “They’re inconsistent with international law. Our administration maintains firm opposition to settlement expansion. And in our judgment, this only weakens — it doesn’t strengthen — Israel’s security.”Mr. Blinken was in Argentina for meetings with the recently elected president, Javier Milei, and the foreign minister, Diana Mondino.In Washington, John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, reiterated that stance in comments to reporters. “This is a position that has been consistent over a range of Republican and Democratic administrations — if there’s an administration that is being inconsistent, it was the previous one,” he said.State Department officials declined to say what actions, if any, the United States might take to hold Israeli settlers or the government legally accountable for the building of new settlements.

Ron DeSantis said he would “be wrestling with” over the weekend and has not yet signed — could potentially upend the lives of millions of young people in Florida.It would also probably face constitutional challenges. Federal courts have blocked less-restrictive youth social media laws enacted last year by Arkansas and Ohio. Judges in those cases said the new statutes most likely impinged on social media companies’ free speech rights to distribute information as well as young people’s rights to have access to it.The new rules in Florida, passed on Thursday, would require social networks to both prevent people under 16 from signing up for accounts and terminate accounts that a platform knew or believed belonged to underage users. It would apply to apps and sites with certain features, most likely including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.

Trump and 14 of his allies in Georgia has been buffeted by an effort to disqualify the main prosecutor, Fani T. Willis, because she engaged in a romantic relationship with a lawyer she hired to help with the case.Mr. Trump and a number of his co-defendants hope to convince a judge that the relationship has created a conflict of interest that should be grounds for disqualifying Ms. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, the hired lawyer, Nathan J. Wade, and Ms. Willis’s entire office. A key question is whether Ms. Willis reaped any financial benefit from hiring Mr. Wade, who has been paid more than $650,000 for his work on the case. If successful, the effort would very likely sow chaos in one of the most ambitious of the criminal cases against Mr. Trump.The accusations were first made in a Jan. 8 court motion filed by Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign official. After refraining from commenting on the matter for weeks, Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade acknowledged in a Feb. 2 court filing that a “personal relationship” had developed between them, but only after she hired him.On Feb. 15 and 16, an evidentiary hearing was held in which Ms. Willis, Mr. Wade and several other witnesses were called to the stand to testify about the prosecutors’ relationship.

Willis, should be disqualified from leading the prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump on election interference charges.If Judge Scott McAfee determines that Ms. Willis has a conflict of interest because of her romantic relationship with the prosecutor she hired to manage the case, and that it merits disqualification, his decision would, by extension, disqualify her entire office.The case would then be reassigned to another Georgia prosecutor, who would have the ability to continue with the case exactly as it is, make major changes — such as adding or dropping charges or defendants — or to even drop the case altogether. The decision to drop the case would end the prosecution of Mr. Trump and his allies for their actions in Georgia after the 2020 election, when the former president sought to overturn his loss in the state.It would be up to a state entity called the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia to find someone else to take up the case. More specifically, the decision would fall to the council’s executive director, Pete Skandalakis, an experienced former prosecutor.

Trump are continuing to press their argument that the lead prosecutors in the Georgia election interference case are lying about when their romantic relationship began, surfacing phone records on Friday that they will likely use to try to undercut the prosecutors’ testimony.In a court filing, Mr. Trump’s lawyers in Atlanta presented an affidavit describing phone records obtained through a subpoena that they said showed more than 2,000 calls between Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, and Nathan Wade, the lawyer she hired to help oversee the case, in the first 11 months of 2021.The original affidavit alleged that the two exchanged roughly 12,000 text messages over that period. But later on Friday, the lawyers for Mr. Trump released a corrected version of the affidavit that removed the reference to 12,000 text messages, and instead claimed that “just under 12,000 interactions” occurred between the two lawyers. The updated affidavit defined “interactions” as including voice calls and text messages.There is no dispute that Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis were in contact in 2021. They are longtime friends, and after Ms. Willis was elected district attorney in 2020, she appointed Mr. Wade to a hiring committee to screen applicants for jobs in the district attorney’s office. She also consulted with Mr. Wade on a number of issues, including strategic questions about big cases, after taking office in January 2021.

This was in 2016, and Mr. Favor was trying to get sober, after 13 years of active cocaine addiction. When he heard about the puppy, at a rescue organization where he occasionally volunteered, he knew he couldn’t take her.“I’m too new into sobriety,” he told his fiancée at the time, who also volunteered at the rescue center. Another tragedy in his life, he said, might drive him back to drugs.Then he met Honey.Mr. Favor is a big tough guy, son of a cop, a self-described “street dude” with a chip on his shoulder.

A progressive Palestinian American community organizer in Dearborn, Mich., a majority Arab American city near Detroit, she doesn’t want to see Donald Trump back in office.“Donald Trump has never been a friend to our community,” she told me as we sat in an airy, modern Yemeni coffee shop. But to win her back, she said, “the very bare minimum” Biden needs to do is to completely overhaul America’s relationship with Israel, demand a permanent end to hostilities and end American military aid to Israel, at least as long as its war in Gaza drags on.Given how strong support for Israel is in the Democratic and Republican Parties, I’m fairly confident that an aid cutoff is not going to happen anytime soon. But speaking to Elabed, the younger sister of Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic congresswoman, I sensed a chasm between my resigned assumptions about how American politics works and her convictions about what’s necessary to stave off even more mass death in Gaza.“We’re looking at unprecedented times where we are watching a genocide unfold in front of our eyes,” said Elabed. Biden’s backing of Israel may be predictable, given both his own avowed Zionism and the political influence of Israel’s American champions, but to her and others like her, it’s become intolerable. That’s why Elabed is managing the Listen to Michigan campaign, which is organizing to get people to protest Biden’s handling of the war by voting “uncommitted” in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.

Israel’s war in response to the devastating attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 has led the Israeli government to ratchet up those social, economic and legal pressures, putting an already vulnerable people in an especially thorny place and threatening the fragile links between Jewish and Palestinian citizens.That is a terrible mistake.Most of Israel’s two million Palestinian citizens, who make up about 20 percent of the national population, hold on to their Palestinian identity, language and culture. At the same time they speak Hebrew, participate in Israeli politics to varying degrees and are generally acquainted with Jewish and Israeli culture. They hold a unique position, as perhaps the only group that continues to form friendship, partnership and solidarity ties — albeit often flawed and partial — with both the Palestinians across the border and the Jewish citizens of Israel.
39;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/opinion/alabama-embroyo-dobbs-reproductive-freedom.html;Opinion | Samuel Alito Opened the Door to Reproductive Hell;Despite the lofty and expansive rhetoric of his majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Justice Samuel Alito insisted throughout the text that the actual decision was more modest than it might appear. The end of Roe, he said, was not the end of abortion access as much as it was the beginning of a new era of democratic deliberation and decision making. No longer shackled by a prior dictate of the Supreme Court, the people were free to choose. “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” Alito wrote.But, as the legal scholars Melissa Murray and Kate Shaw (who is also a contributing Opinion writer) argue in a recent article in The Harvard Law Review, it is difficult to square Alito and the Dobbs majority’s paeans to democracy with their pointed hostility to both voting rights and equal representation. “Viewing the Roberts court’s many interventions in this sphere in tandem,” they write, “it is clear that this is a court that no longer understands itself as largely or primarily functioning to facilitate the exercise of meaningful democracy in these ways, rather, in many instances, it appears to be actively working to undermine these goals.”There was more at work in the Dobbs opinion than the majority’s disingenuous concern for democratic participation. Alito and his conservative colleagues did not just open the door to new abortion restrictions, they took aim at broader rights to bodily autonomy and personal freedom while laying the groundwork for the divisive notion of fetal personhood — an idea that, for all the court’s talk of democracy, is fundamentally incompatible with any modern notion of equal citizenship.As Murray and Shaw observe, “The court’s repeated references to ‘fetal life,’ ‘potential life’ and ‘unborn human being[s]’ may have been designed” to “broadcast receptivity to such claims to litigants and lower courts.” What’s more, some courts have already “eagerly embraced this fetus-forward posture.”
40;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/opinion/true-detective.html;Opinion | Where Did the ‘True Detective’ Magic Go? To Another Show.;If I were asked to condense the entire era of prestige television — all its plots, moods, tropes and aesthetics — for time travelers from an entirely different entertainment era, I’d probably have them sit down and watch the first season of “True Detective,” the eight episodes starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey during his “McConaisance” career phase of perfect role selection. In those eight-odd hours of television drama from 2014, you can see almost all the distinctive features of prestige TV as we’ve known it for the past 25-odd years.Like many prestige-era shows, the original “True Detective” is a dark reworking of a traditional American genre, in this case the police procedural in which odd-couple detective partners turn out to be perfect for each other. It’s a small-screen story that draws a lot of oomph from casting marquee big-screen actors. It’s a drama pitched to blue-state HBO subscribers that’s set somewhere “out there,” beyond the creative-class cosmopolis, where liberal modernity seemingly dissolves back into violence and primitivism.Like “The Sopranos,” “Breaking Bad,” “Mad Men” and many other shows, it’s a story about “difficult” men who embody a fading patriarchy but somehow retain audience sympathy even as they deal out violence and mistreat the women in their lives.Like the collected works of the HBO Davids — Chase, Milch and Simon — it’s a show made with an auteur spirit, except that in the case of “True Detective” not one but two auteurish figures guided its development, the novelist-turned-showrunner Nic Pizzolatto, responsible for plot and dialogue, and the director responsible for its memorable aesthetic, Cary Joji Fukunaga.

Not only did America’s economy defy widespread predictions of recession, it also defied claims that only a significant rise in unemployment could bring inflation under control. Instead, we got a combination of strong growth, unemployment near a 50-year low and plunging inflation.But last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in January, more than most analysts expected. And the usual suspects — inflation perma-bears, political enemies of the Biden administration and economists who wrongly predicted that disinflation would require mass unemployment — jumped on the data as if it were a fumbled football.So, are the good times over?No. Everything we know suggests that those disappointing numbers were mostly a statistical blip rather than marking a significant worsening in inflation trends.Before I explain how such blips can happen, let me tell you what indicators I was looking at after the inflation reports.

It was clear where the prime minister wanted the headlines to focus.Netanyahu’s plan was in many ways antithetical to what the Biden administration has been trying to achieve. Among other things, it called for Israeli “operational freedom of action in the entire Gaza Strip without a time limit,” while Washington has been trying to avoid a push into the city of Rafah, packed with displaced Gazans, and it envisioned a buffer zone that would further reduce the territory of the Gaza Strip, already one of the most crowded places on earth. And it made no mention of the Palestinian Authority in any future administration of Gaza, as Washington envisions.Netanyahu didn’t say why he released a plan that differed sharply from what American mediators were discussing in Paris. He and other Israeli officials had been meeting earlier in the week with President Biden’s Mideast envoy, Brett McGurk, in talks the White House described as “constructive.” The most generous interpretation would be that Netanyahu was setting out a hard position to put pressure on Hamas, which has been pushing its own hard line. But Netanyahu could also be signaling to Washington that he and his far-right coalition partners have their own agenda, and it does not correspond to the proposals being discussed in Paris, including the movement toward a two-state solution that is the Biden administration’s longer-term goal. Netanyahu has a long history of rebuffing American peace initiatives while claiming to support them, but in the current crisis he has tried Biden’s patience to the limit. If Israelis come to believe that he is deliberately delaying the release of Israeli hostages, of whom 100 are believed to be still alive, he would risk antagonizing not only a large portion of the public, but also the members of his war cabinet who have been working with the Americans.Show more

Carve on this memorial the names of public figures actively denying the existence of climate change. Carve the names so deep and large, our grandchildren and great-grandchildren need not search the archives.This is not a metaphor. The problem with climate change is the disconnect between action and impact. If politicians vote against construction standards and a school collapses, the next election will be their last. But with climate change, cause and effect are at a vast distance.We are already seeing the consequences of our past and present greenhouse gas emissions. In coming decades, those emissions will wreak their full havoc on the climate, and it will take hundreds, possibly thousands, of years for those pollutants to fully dissipate. But in the short term, the most immediate burdens are borne mostly by the poor in America and distant people in distant lands. Misaligned incentives are at the heart of why some political and business leaders deny and delay.For them, there can be immediate political and economic benefits to avowed ignorance, and by the time the waters rise, their deeds and words will be forgotten. A memorial would help adjust for this temporal gap. It would serve as a permanent testament of climate deniers whose actions might otherwise be lost to history and a reminder to those weighing their words today of what the future may bring.

In vitro fertilization was new, expensive and not often successful. I was desperate to have a child. I was also Catholic and believed that life began at conception.What about all those embryos that would be thrown away or frozen forever? In my mind, they became angels, every one of them helping the one embryo that would become life.I did not become pregnant with I.V.F., but my stance toward abortion changed radically and permanently. If I could sacrifice those little “angel” embryos in my hope for a new life, who was I to tell a 14-year-old girl (or anyone) that she could not sacrifice her embryos in the hopes for her own life?To this day I support the mother’s right to choose. I believe that God gives this choice to the mother. I am still Catholic.

He is behind in the polls. He is skipping things like Super Bowl interviews, having trouble in press conferences and that if things don’t change, this is not going to go well. And that there is another option for Democrats, that Biden could step aside and Democrats could do what parties have done many times before and go to a convention.Then we had Elaine Kamarck on the show to talk about how the convention would work.

Thanks for doing this.paul krugmanIt should be fun.ross douthatYou say that now, but —michelle cottleNow, now, Ross, behave yourself.carlos lozadaBe nice to the guests, please, Ross.ross douthatYeah, there’s just mild hazing involved.michelle cottleFrom “New York Times Opinion,” I’m Michelle Cottle.ross douthatI’m Ross Douthat.carlos lozadaI’m Carlos Lozada.michelle cottleAnd this is “Matter of Opinion.” [MUSIC PLAYING] So our beloved Lydia is out, but we have drafted an extra special guest to help us out this week. We’ve been talking a lot about big issues at play in this year’s presidential election. And today, by God, we’re going to try to understand what exactly is going on with the economy. Are we headed into a recession? Are we just having what all the cool kids call a vibe session? What’s driving public feelings about the situation? And do those feelings favor Joe Biden or Donald Trump? Now, we’ll get to politics later. But first, our “Times” colleague, the Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, has graciously agreed to step in and help everyone, especially me, make sense of a very confusing economic picture. Paul, welcome. Thank you so much.carlos lozadaWelcome, Paul.paul krugmanHi, there.michelle cottleSo we are obviously delighted to have you here. And my opening question for you about the economy is, am I right to be confused? Are you confused? Help me out here.paul krugmanI’m actually not feeling very confused, which is probably a bad sign. But — — basically it’s still mostly a story of a soft landing, that a very rough couple of years, mostly as a result of aftershocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation with some bumps, pretty close to where we wanted to be. Could there be a recession? Always.[chuckles]There can always be a recession. But there’s very little hint of one in any of the data that we have right now. So I’m much less confused now than I was a year ago. Right now the picture looks pretty clear.ross douthatWe had never in my lifetime had a global pandemic as an economic factor. Can you just sort of tell us your story about why 2021 and 2022 were so bumpy? What’s your story about inflation right now and other problems as well?paul krugmanThe main thing that happened — so it was what in the jargon we would call a supply shock, but a funny one. It wasn’t so much that people stopped producing stuff or couldn’t produce stuff. What happened was that people changed what they bought. So that the elitist classic example, but it’s representative, people stopped going to the gym and they bought Pelotons instead, or they stopped going out to eat and they bought kitchen equipment instead. There was this big shift of demand from in-person services to goods. And it turns out that, in the very short run, the economy isn’t as flexible as all that. So if people start wanting to buy stuff — physical stuff — instead of in-person services, well, that stuff has to be produced, has to be shipped. And right at the beginning, actually, the White House did an analysis back in 2021, just as inflation was taking off, saying, what does this look like? And they said this looks like the immediate aftermath of World War II. This looks like the period when we were reconverting from a war economy back to a peacetime economy, which was a period of major inflation. And that analogy — for a while there, people were saying, well, this is going on so long. How can that be the story? But in the end, it does look a lot sort of 1947, ‘48.ross douthatBut why does inflation take off then as the pandemic ends, rather than at the peak when everyone’s ordering Pelotons?paul krugmanWell, actually the peak — remember, the economy was quite depressed. And so overall spending fell quite a lot during 2020, during the worst of the pandemic. It’s when the economy started rebounding, but rebounding in a different way. Well, we had 14 percent unemployment in 2020. And with 14 percent unemployment, it doesn’t matter what people are buying. There’s plenty of excess capacity to satisfy it. But when you start getting back towards 5 percent, 4 percent unemployment, but the stuff that people are doing with their wages is now very different from what they were doing before, that’s when inflation takes off. By the way, I think it’s worth pointing out — we’re Americans, we don’t believe the rest of the world exists. But the cumulative increase in prices in the euro area is almost exactly the same as it was in the United States. So you have a place that never had the Biden stimulus, never had a lot of our policies, and yet their inflation experience — it was a little delayed. Inflation took off sooner and ended sooner — came down sooner in the US. But if you look at the cumulative from January 2020 to January 2024, both sides of the Atlantic look the same.carlos lozadaIs your implication then that inflation was more of a reflection of larger forces and not necessarily induced by policy moves in the United States?paul krugmanYeah, I mean, that’s — for a while there, it looked as if that big Biden spending package was driving it. And it may have brought the inflation forward in time. So we had our inflation spike sooner than the Europeans did. But in the end — and particularly you can look — if you look at how inflation came down, it was not at all — there were a lot of economists — thankfully, I wasn’t one of them — who were saying we’re going to need massive unemployment and only by throwing the economy into a recession can we bring inflation down. Instead, inflation came down painlessly. And if you look into the details, it was very much the parts of the economy where supply expanded, as we worked out the kinks from the legacy of COVID are the places where inflation came down most. So it’s really consistent with a story that says that these were these larger forces that we probably would have had about the same inflation cumulatively. The timing might have been different. But it would have probably been about the same, whatever the policies had been, whoever had been in the White House.ross douthatSo to maybe simplify things a little bit, people are now doing better than they were pre-pandemic. And it seems like after a bout of inflation, the key question is, at what point do wages start outpacing inflation again, because that’s the point at which most people are going to start feeling like the economy is doing better, is actually improving. And there’s a lot of — in the data — a lot of different arguments about where we stand with that. But what’s your view on where are we with that? When did wages start outpacing inflation again from your perspective? How long have we been — have wages been growing faster than inflation, do you think?paul krugmanOh, no, it’s well over a year. I mean, inflation peaked around the middle of 2022 and has since fallen off drastically. And you really have to torture the data not to find that most workers are certainly better off than they were in January 2023, and better off by a few percent than they were in January 2020. And right now if we’re just going to be looking at recent developments, it’s all sunny.carlos lozadaPaul, I wanted to ask you a little more deeply about COVID. I mean, there’s been so much discussion about how the pandemic has affected our workplace culture, our relationships, our commutes, the way we live, et cetera. But what would you say is the lasting legacy of COVID for our economic lives, not just in a aftershock kind of sense, but in a more long haul kind of sense.paul krugmanYeah, I mean, it’s not at all clear. There were a lot of things that people thought were going to be long-term affected. They thought that a lot of people would leave the workforce and never come back, which has turned out to be basically not true. The big thing is actually working from home, which it turns out that enough people like it and enough businesses have adapted to it that that’s a permanent change, which has lots of — it’s probably beneficial for the economy as a whole, but it’s not beneficial if you’re the owner of an office building.carlos lozadaIs it beneficial just because it’s more efficient?paul krugmanWell, the evidence on what it does to productivity is mixed. But there’s a lot of time that people spend commuting that is now saved.michelle cottleYeah, I only wash my hair when I have to come in and see Carlos. So —carlos lozadaI haven’t washed my hair in six months. So it’s really —paul krugmanActually, one funny thing is when people did start — I’m back in some in-person meetings. But everybody gave up on ties.michelle cottleAh.carlos lozadaTies are over.paul krugmanSo we finally ended the tyranny of the men’s ties.michelle cottleTies are so over. So obviously we’re in better shape now than a couple of years ago. But it’s not entirely clear that the public opinion has caught up with this yet. So where are we in this so-called vibe session? And by that I mean how people are feeling about the economy.paul krugmanThat’s — I mean, I’m spending a lot of time on that, as I think everybody who is reading me knows. And that’s a very weird thing. If you say Americans don’t feel good about the economy — strictly speaking, Republicans don’t feel good about the economy. Among self-identified Democrats, consumer sentiment, which was fairly low when inflation was at its peak, is right back to where it was before the pandemic. Among Republicans, although it’s up some in the last few months, it’s still very depressed. So people’s evaluation of the economy seems to depend on their politics instead of the other way around.michelle cottleAll right, so before we get too far into the politics, this seems like a good time to take a break. We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] And we’re back. Now we’re going to take all that information that our special guest has explained to us. Thank you so much, Paul.paul krugmanOh, yeah.michelle cottleAnd debate the politics, and I know we all have opinions on this one. So let’s start with the voters. Why do we think that people on both sides are a little bit pessimistic?carlos lozadaYeah, I mean I think Paul mentioned the partisan gap in the way we think about the economy. And that means that, to some extent, your views on the economy depend on whether your party, your favorite politicians are in office. That seems to be stronger for Republicans than for Democrats whose views tend to track a little more with the actual economic indicators. But I think there’s a way in which even a nominally strong economy can still have you feeling pessimistic. I just — I mean, I just look at my own circumstances. I have a good job with a good salary. But I’m scared that AI is going to kill that good job and that my good salary will never be enough to pay three college tuitions that are facing me down, you know. And so I think there are ways in which you can look at positive current conditions and still be concerned about long-term economic prospects. And that can cloud that vision.michelle cottleSo the anticipation of trouble down the road. So it’s not that people aren’t necessarily responding rationally, they’re just looking at the longer term?carlos lozadaI’m just saying that those are rational concerns, right, depending on your time horizon.paul krugmanMy last newsletter was called “Believing is Seeing,” and it’s definitely the case that a lot of voters’ perceptions of the economy and of other stuff are very much based upon what they think, based on their politics, should be true rather than what’s actually going on. And it’s really clear in the economic data. It’s really clear on views on crime. Now, should everybody be feeling happy and comfortable and at no risk? No, of course, not. There is — I mean, could technology come for your job? Yes, of course, it could. I guess my question there is always, when has that not been true? Technology doesn’t have to be AI. It doesn’t have to be robots. It can be anything. But it’s hard to really think that the amount of risk and uncertainty is greater now than it’s been pretty much since the Industrial Revolution.ross douthatI mean, I think it’s worth speaking up for the theory that I know Paul disagrees with, to some extent, that people just really don’t like inflation in a way that lingers in polling data and people’s perceptions of the economy, even after the headline number inflation rate has come down.michelle cottleWell, historically speaking, do we have a sense of how long that lasts?paul krugmanEstimating lags is one of the hardest things to do.michelle cottleYeah.paul krugmanIn principle, we tend to look at inflation over a one-year period. And it makes a lot of sense to think that people’s memories extend further back than that. Not forever. I don’t think people are out there pining for the days when a McDonald’s hamburger was $0.15. But the idea that people are still shocked at how much prices are up since 2019. I was much more of a fan of that until I started looking at the consumer sentiment numbers, which, among those who are persuadable, those numbers started turning up in the second half of 2022.michelle cottleBefore you go further, can you just explain the difference? For those of us who are not economists, the difference between consumer sentiment numbers and what we were originally talking about.paul krugmanOh, OK. Consumer sentiment — so we have various surveys that, in one way or another, ask, is the economy good or not, how good are you feeling about the economy. We also ask people, by the way, how are you feeling about your own finances, and there’s been a really big gap there. If you ask, how was 2023, we have large majorities of people of all political affiliations saying, OK, good or great. And if you ask, how was it for the country, then if you’re a Republican, you say it was disastrous. And there appeared to be a lot of people who you ask how is the economy doing and their answer is I hate Joe Biden. But for what it’s worth, among people who don’t appear to be answering that question, their assessment of how the economy is, what’s the state of the economy, started turning up in the second half of 2022, just as the inflation numbers started coming down. The argument that says that people care about the level of prices not the rate of change of prices, which is the inflation rate, that has a problem with the timing. And among — again, I want to separate out a little bit, but among people who don’t self-identify as Republicans, views of the economy have improved right in tandem with the falling inflation rate. So I mean, what Ross was saying is something that I actually, if you’d asked me four or five months ago, I would have agreed with. But I’ve been looking at the numbers on what people say about the economy, and they don’t actually seem consistent with that story.ross douthatBut so I’m looking at Gallup data right now on the question that tries to unite the political and the economic, the famous are you better off than you were four years ago question, right?paul krugmanYeah.ross douthatAnd so, in 2020, not surprisingly, when Donald Trump was on the ballot — this is pre-COVID — 90 percent of Republicans say they’re better off than they were four years ago. 30 percent of Democrats — so you have a big partisan divide on both sides. And 60 percent of independents say they’re better off than they were four years ago. Flash forward to Biden and the partisan numbers swing. Now most Democrats say they’re better off. Most Republicans say they’re worse off. But for independents, it’s 48 percent saying they’re better off, down from 60 percent under Trump. So if you take independents as a kind of control group, and obviously they lean left or right, but some of them are swing voters, they do seem unhappier right now than they were in 2020. And if it’s not inflation, we need some explanation besides Fox News for why those voters are sour on the how has Biden done question.michelle cottleI mean, do we think people are just sour in general because they have a pandemic hangover?paul krugmanWell, I talked to political scientists, and you ask them about independents and they say they basically don’t exist. That the great bulk of people who say they’re independent are really strongly partisan leaners, either Democratic or Republican. There’s only a small segment of the population that’s truly independent. And if we ask why independent voters are down on the economy, well, think of the independents as being half Democrats and half Republicans. And we know that these partisan effects are much stronger for Republicans than they are for Democrats. They exist for Democrats. But the independent number is going to be somewhat depressed because the people who say they’re independents, but are really Republicans, are going to be much more passionate in being negative about a Biden economy than the independents — people who claim they’re independents but are really Democrats.ross douthatBut, Paul —paul krugmanIt’s not clear to me that that’s additional information.ross douthat— but that doesn’t make — that does not explain the wild swings in Joe Biden’s approval rating. In 2021, In the first year of his presidency, he had approval ratings consistently near 50 percent. And today, his approval ratings are much lower. And he’s losing to Trump, which he never was in the polls in 2020. So even if you say the number of swing voters, genuine swing voters, is really small, still there are clearly some genuinely unhappy swing voters whose unhappiness will determine the outcome of the next election.michelle cottleYeah, which brings me to the question of this kind of pessimism does tend to come back on whoever is in charge. So what do we think the president should be doing about all of this as he goes into this very tough race?paul krugmanYeah, the short answer is why should I know? But look, what I think is quite possibly true is that there is a hangover of discontent reflecting not just inflation, but just in general. The pandemic was an enormously disruptive event. I don’t know if there’s a formula. I mean, there are some people on the left who say, oh, Biden shouldn’t talk about how good the economy is because there are lots of people who are still poor and suffering. That’s always been true. And if a Democrat can’t run on his record because we are at utopia, then that’s a council of complete political despair. They can try to talk it up. But I don’t know. I mean, if I had to say the thing that most amazes me about the current state of political debate is the way that most of 2020 has been kind of vanished down the memory hole. People talk about all the great job market under Trump. But he was the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer Americans working than before. So people sort of say — it’s as if history stopped in January 2020 and everything after that is not his fault. But somehow all of the pandemic related stuff that continued after Biden came into office is his fault.carlos lozadaI just wonder that one way to maybe square that circle is that the pandemic in 2020 was a shock to the system. And perhaps that is one reason why Trump would get somewhat more of a pass than when Biden comes into office a year later already kind of knowing that that’s what he was going to be facing. So perhaps the standard can be higher than for the president who is surprised by the event along with the rest of us.michelle cottleYeah, I wonder how much of this is public expectations on what the timeline for a return to normal would be, and that obviously was on Biden’s watch mostly.paul krugmanYeah, we were all — I mean, everyone was surprised by — there was — within the economics, there was team transitory versus team permanent. And at this point, it looks like team transitory was right. But transitory turned out to be 18 months not six months. And what I think you can say is that it may be true that people saw the pandemic as a global event outside the president’s control. They don’t see the inflation that happened afterwards as a global event outside the president’s control, even though, if you look at the numbers, it was. But how many ordinary Americans are looking at European inflation statistics? So I’m not sure that we really know in these days what to make of any of these things. I mean, again, I talk to political scientists, and they’ve been saying presidential approval just doesn’t mean what it used to mean because we now have such hard partisanship that the presidential approval is remarkably insensitive to developments in the world. So we really don’t know what to make of this. And anyone who thinks that we can predict the election based upon polls right now is in for a tongue lashing if you talk to any actual serious political analyst.carlos lozadaPaul, I want to take you for a second in the Wayback Machine here. And you wrote a book in the ‘90s called “The Age of Diminished Expectations.”paul krugmanYeah.carlos lozadaWhich I read in graduate school. And if I remember it correctly, you wrote that even during periods of broad economic expansion, the economy is just not delivering the kind of progress that Americans had taken for granted in the past. You had people feeling worse off than their parents, fearing their kids would be worse off than they were. When you think about that, these three decades later, what are our economic expectations like now?paul krugmanWell, I wrote that book in 1989, believe it or not. So it was —carlos lozadaI read one of the later editions. You kept updating it.michelle cottleIt was a different world.paul krugmanYeah. When I was writing that book, the big story was that we had all this fancy technology. Personal computers were still new and trendy, but it wasn’t showing at all in economic performance. Then we’ve actually spent the last 15 or so years in another period when we have all this fancy technology that doesn’t seem to be delivering a whole lot in terms of people’s living standards. So I think people are feeling sour. I think at some level people do look and say, I have all this technology that my parents didn’t have. Why am I finding it so hard to buy a house? Whereas, the American dream, which is partly just nostalgia — and again, I just want to come back and say that this is a — we’re just a far, far more divided society than we were. And a lot of the negativity comes from people who don’t like where the country has gone politically, culturally, rather than a response to concrete conditions.michelle cottleSo wrapping all of this together, I mean, do we think that this economy as an issue is going to favor Trump or Biden in this election? I mean, my thought is that it’s going to be Trump just because it always comes back on whoever is in charge.carlos lozadaIt could benefit Trump in the way that you say, Michelle. I also wonder to what extent we think that that partisan gap in perceptions of the economy is immovable? Or if a sustained period of several more months of positive economic outcomes could put a dent in it? In which case, by the time November rolls around and people are voting, you could see a strong economy benefiting Biden. I guess I don’t know what sort of economic growth — how strong does the economy have to be to overpower the partisan lens through which voters look at the economy?paul krugmanI have a, actually, almost exactly opposite take —michelle cottleOh, interesting.paul krugman— which is that right now if you look at who thinks that the economy is bad, it is basically committed Republicans. And they’re never going to vote for Biden regardless. And there’s been a big improvement in perceptions of the economy among Democrats, which might mean that it actually doesn’t matter at all, that nobody’s going to move on this. And it might mean that some people on the fence will, in fact, notice an improving economy and go for Biden. But my personal guess is that the economy will actually altogether be less of an issue in this election than people imagine. That it’s going to be decided on enthusiasm, turnout, driven largely by non-economic issues.michelle cottleAll right, so Paul’s a vote for it’s not the economy, stupid.paul krugmanRight. Democrats have been doing really, really well in special elections. But that’s not because people voting in Queens or whatever are feeling good about the economy. It’s because the non-economic issues have actually been playing in Democrats’ favor. That people are being turned out by Roe v. Wade. And they’re been turned out by fear of authoritarianism. This is not — this is really — it’s the economy, stupid, that was 1992. And 1992 was a long time ago. It was really a very, very different country. And since then, the economy has mattered — it seems to matter less and less for the election.michelle cottleAll right, Ross, you want to have the last word on this one.ross douthatYeah, I mean, I’m a vote for the economy matters. We don’t know for sure why people — again, not just Republicans — are unhappier with the condition of the country than Paul’s analysis of where we are economically says they should be. But I still think the way to bet is that if you have six months of a booming stock market — stock market hasn’t gone up much under Biden, now it’s going up — six months of wages continuing to outpace inflation, six months where inflation actually gets down to where it was before Biden, which it hasn’t yet, then that helps Biden win. There are locked in coalitions, yeah, of 40 percent to 45 percent of Americans. But just in both 2016 and 2020, you saw real swings of different constituencies. And again, it matters on the margin, but I think that happens again. Whereas, if inflation starts creeping back up, I think that’s really, really bad news for Biden’s re-election campaign.michelle cottleSo you’re a “it depends.”ross douthatNo, I’m — — no, I think —carlos lozadaNo, he thinks the economy —ross douthatWell, I think it depends. But I think that if you take Paul’s understanding of where the economy is right now and you project it forward — you just say it continues for six more months — I think you would bet on Biden winning re-election.carlos lozadaOne thing I’ll say is that even when it was the economy, stupid, it wasn’t really the economy, stupid in ‘92. If you remember the full slogan in the war room with Carville and company, it was three parts. It was change versus more of the same, the economy, stupid, and don’t forget about health care. So even then, it was multiple things that they were focused on. And I think that’s still the case.ross douthatCan I ask one more question?michelle cottleWell, I guess you can now.ross douthatPaul, I just want to ask about America’s fiscal capacity, meaning how much money we can spend in the future without running into inflation again, because it seemed to me like one of the big lessons of the entire Obama era, where I think you were consistently arguing that America could get away with a lot more deficit spending than a lot of conservatives and Republicans and even Democrats thought, and that seemed to be true throughout Obama’s presidency and throughout Trump’s presidency. But now in the COVID era, we spent a ton of money. We got inflation back. And I’m just curious where you think that argument stands? Can America take on more debt in a Biden’s second term, in a Trump second term, without just having inflation immediately come back, whether it’s via new spending or tax cuts?paul krugmanOK, I don’t think inflation is the issue. The question now is, is there a limit on how much debt the US can run up? We are running persistent deficits. The level of debt relative to GDP has been rising and is now at its highest level since the end of World War II. And it’s one of those things where you look at it and you say, well, this can’t go on forever. On the other hand, you look at the history of advanced countries borrowing in their own currencies and you find that it is really impossible to find any example of a country hitting the wall. And so there is an issue that we have an aging population, that we’ve made a lot of promises to people who are at or approaching the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare. And at some point, in some sense, we have to find the resources for that. But it really doesn’t — there’s not a hint in market reactions, not a hint in international history that we’re anywhere close to hitting that breaking point.michelle cottleOK, so, listeners, we’d like to hear from you on this. So please tell us how the state of the economy will affect your vote and why. Leave us a voicemail at 212-556-7440 or you can email us at matterofopinion@nytimes.com. So let’s take a quick break. And when we come back, we’re going to get hot and cold. [MUSIC PLAYING] And finally, it’s time for some hot cold, where every week one of us shares something we’re into, over, or somewhere in between. So who’s got this week?ross douthatIt’s me. I was going to say something about being hot for showing kids old movies, meaning, from my perspective, movies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. But actually, what I’m hot for is using old movies to acquaint your children with the harsh realities of aging and mortality. In recent days, we have showed our kids a couple of movies. “The Man Who Would be King,” the Rudyard Kipling adaptation with Sean Connery and Michael Caine.michelle cottleGreat movie.ross douthatGreat movie. And the even better movie, “Bridge on the River Kwai” from 1957 with Sir Alec Guinness.michelle cottleAlso a great movie.ross douthatAlso a great movie. And in both cases, our kids’ previous exposure to Alec Guinness was, of course, as Obi-Wan Kenobi in “Star Wars” and to Michael Caine was as Scrooge in “The Muppet Christmas Carol.” And so in each case, we basically rewound the clock on those actors. And my 11-year-old daughter just stared in horror and shock when she realized that the voice of Alec Guinness as the middle-aged 40-something British officer was also the voice of the aged Obi-Wan Kenobi. And Michael Caine — our kids basically think that Michael Caine is like the biggest global celebrity ever because he was also a voice — I think he was a voice — no, he was a voice in “Cars 2” where he was a British secret agent, right? So he’s everywhere.carlos lozadaYes, yes, that’s right.ross douthatWe showed them the famous Michael Caine impersonation.carlos lozadaThat impersonation contest is glorious.ross douthatMichael Caine — no, no, that’s not Michael Caine.carlos lozadaWe’ve been doing Cold War movies at home. So recently “The Manchurian Candidate,” “Dr. Strangelove,” “War Games.”ross douthatOh, “War Games.”carlos lozadaYes, it’s excellent. So that’s been our dip into old old-ish movies.paul krugmanAnd it’s funny because we’ve been taking a bit of a time trip as well, streaming “Rumpole of the Bailey.”michelle cottleI’ve never seen that.paul krugmanWell, we’ve had fond memories of it once upon a time. Watching it again — two things — one, god, Britain was a lot more British — — than it is now.ross douthatCareful, Paul.paul krugmanIt’s just the whole culture seems far more alien than modern Britain does to an American. And second, maybe it is getting older, and I turned on the closed captioning —michelle cottleOh, yeah.paul krugman— because I was having a little trouble understanding. All of this received pronunciation is actually harder to track than it used to be. But actually, in a way it’s a demonstration of how homogenized global culture has been because I think Britain and America are a lot more similar than they used to be.michelle cottleHmm. All right, well, on that international note, I think we’re going to call it for the week. Paul, thank you so much —carlos lozadaThank you, Paul.michelle cottle— for coming to help us out.ross douthatThank you so much, Paul.paul krugmanThank you.michelle cottleAll right, guys, let’s do this again next week.carlos lozadaSee you next week.

48;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/21/opinion/homelessness-crisis-america-stories.html;Voices from Inside America’s Homelessness Crisis - The New York Times;The shelter comes after it all. After the pawnship and plasma donation. After the diagnosis, the divorce, the eviction, the relapse. After the final family member says no.Emergency shelters provide a place to sleep — even if only a mat on a floor — and meals. At some, you can get clean socks, a haircut, a tooth pulled, even therapy. The shelter represents the last stop from the bottom, a bulwark from the street, but it can also represent a chance: to leave your abuser, to earn your G.E.D., to make a new start.Homelessness is highest in cities with exorbitant rents, but small cities and rural communities are not shielded from the housing crisis. Some small towns have eviction rates that rival those of big cities. Because rural America lacks many social services, like free clinics, soup kitchens and shelters, the rural homeless often make their way to places like the Water Street Mission. A Christian rescue mission in Lancaster, Pa., a city of roughly 57,000, it has been serving the hungry and homeless since 1917.We spoke with several people staying at the Water Street Mission, some of whom were there for the first time and some who had sought refuge there many times before.James CostelloBecause there is no single agency or governmental organization that oversees America’s shelter system, shelters can vary as much in funding — some private, some religious, some public — as in the kinds of services and amenities they offer.James Costello, 58, lost a leg to diabetes complications, then his job and housing soon after : When I first came here, we were sleeping on the chapel floor here on “boats.” They were like hard things, maybe about a foot high. And you threw a mat on it and that was what we slept on. And they said: “This is not good for the people. They’re losing dignity.” That’s the one thing here. They want you to have dignity, you’ve lost everything else. So they don’t want to take that from you either. Yeah, you’re in your room with 45 other guys, but you still feel like a person. You don’t feel like cattle being shoved in and shoved out of a room.Tamekia Gibbs, 48, arrived at Water Street after surviving domestic violence : Knowing that you have a place to lay your head and knowing you’ll have food in your mouth, that’s a good thing. It’s everything else that comes along with it, especially if you’ve never been in that predicament — sleeping in a room full of women, you just never know how strange, how stressful that is. You have to get used to different things. You got to get used to having to get used to it.Shawna, 44, is recovering from an addiction and has been in and out of homelessness for over a decade : You don’t have to go, “Well, why are they throwing God in my face all the time?” Just sit down, listen. Maybe that lesson was meant for you and that’s why you’re getting mad. I just go, I listen. If it’s for me, I sit and listen. If not, I play with something on my phone.The resources dedicated to helping people who have lost stable housing in rural communities are more limited, but the causes are often the same as in major cities.Levon Higgins, 50, has been staying at Water Street for the last six months : I just couldn’t afford to live where I was. Rent went up to $1,500 a month. For a two-bedroom. I just couldn’t do it. When the pandemic first started, I had a savings account, had a SIMPLE I.R.A. Over the past year, things just got worse. Your rent just keeps going up and going up and going up.Shawna : This is my fifth or sixth time back. This time I decided to come back just so I could get away from my drug of choice and being out on the street and not feeling safe. My daughter came here after me. This would be her second time back with my grandbabies. We stayed here a couple of times together when it was just me and her. It’s just like I’m reliving everything over again. I know something has to change.Tamekia Gibbs : I endured a lot of physical, emotional and mental abuse. I just got to the point where I lost me completely in that relationship. I said: “This is enough. I got to find somewhere else to go.” So when I did that, of course, it got physical because they didnt want me to leave. I had my son come get me and I took what I could carry. And I’ve been homeless ever since.Tamekia Gibbs Rob Travis JacksonSecuring a spot in a shelter isn’t always straightforward: There are far fewer beds available than people who need them. And for those who get in, adjusting to life in the shelter is its own process.Evelyn, 39, is a mother of two staying in the family section of the mission : When I first got here, I was so mad, so angry, so hurt that I was even put in this position. To be a single mom and have two kids and be out on the streets, it’s very worrisome because they tell you if you don’t have a place, then C.Y.S. [Children and Youth Services] can take your children. Even going to them for help it was like: “Well, if you dont have a place, then we can’t do anything for you. But legally we can take your children.” And it was like: “No, I don’t think so. You’re not taking my children.” So I was scurrying around trying to find shelter for them.Jennifer Berrie, 45, was staying in an overnight-only shelter before Water Street : I miss little things you dont even think of. People complain like I used to about cooking, but then you can’t do it for a while and you miss it. Going to bed when you want, not having a curfew, just, you know, living your life. The freedom.Tamekia Gibbs : There are the ladies that are talking about each other. They’re just doing a lot of backbiting, and when you have that in a community, it causes a lot of friction and tension. I try to stay away from it, I hunker down, do what I’m supposed to in my classes. I stay busy. I tell the ladies: “I came here broken. If I can do it, you can do it.”In addition to addressing the housing crisis and deepening investments in mental health and drug treatment services, the residents of Water Street believe it is critical to treat people in their situation with dignity and empathy.James Costello : This is a human condition. Humans have to solve it. Politics cant do that. And that’s the main problem. With the government it is not going to happen. They’re always going to be wanting money. “Where are we going to get the biggest buck?” And as long as that goes on, this problem is going to get worse.Rob Travis Jackson, 59, became homeless after a financially draining divorce : It’s a little scary to think about what life might be like for any of us after we leave Water Street. If you’re here for a year, you’ve had three meals and three hot meals available through the seasons of the year. And what does my life look like after I leave?Levon Higgins : Some people who come across hard times, it’s because they maybe lost a job or some mental issues that happened. But that’s not how the world sees it. When they see, they automatically assume: “He’s a drug addict. He’s an alcoholic. They dont want to work. They dont want to do nothing.” And that can’t be further from the truth. They just want some help. People get scared to ask for help because they’ve been denied so many times.Shawna

The party was hemorrhaging support from the white working class. More than 60 percent of Americans over 25 do not have a four-year college degree, it’s very hard to win national elections without them.So in 2020 the Democrats did something sensible. For the first time in 36 years, they nominated a presidential candidate who did not have a degree from Harvard or Yale. Joe Biden won the White House and immediately pursued an ambitious agenda to support the working class.The economic results have been fantastic. During Biden’s term, the U.S. economy has created 10.8 million production and nonsupervisory jobs, including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs and 774,000 construction jobs. Wages are rising faster for people at the lower end of the wage scale than for people at the higher end.A study by the economist Robert Pollin and others estimated that 61 percent of the jobs created by the infrastructure law Biden championed wouldn’t require a college degree, the same applied for 58 percent of the jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act and 44 percent of those created by the CHIPS act.
50;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/opinion/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin.html;Opinion | Putin Has Already Lost;As the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, it has become a commonplace that time favors President Vladimir Putin. With Ukraine running low on weaponry and ammunition, American military assistance in doubt and Russia determined to fight on, Ukrainian victory now seems out of reach. Some influential experts go further, insisting that Kyiv will suffer only more death and destruction by persisting and should seek a political settlement with Moscow — even if it requires sacrificing territory.And yet, for all that, Mr. Putin’s war has failed. As Carl von Clausewitz famously stressed, war is not ultimately about killing people and destroying things: It’s a means to achieve specific political ends. Those who start wars expect to be in a better strategic position once the gunfire stops. But even if this war ends with Russia retaining all the Ukrainian land it now holds — a scenario Ukrainians would find more than unpalatable — Moscow’s position will be worse. No matter what, Ukraine will go its own way. For Mr. Putin, more concerned by Ukraine than any other country that arose from the wreckage of the Soviet Union, that alone is tantamount to defeat.If the fundamental purpose of Mr. Putin’s war was to keep Ukraine within Russia’s orbit — politically, culturally and economically — it has had the opposite effect. Ukraine’s leaders and citizens, particularly those from younger generations, have decided that their future lies with the West, not Russia. The prevalence of this mind-set became increasingly palpable over the course of four trips I have taken to Ukraine since the invasion, no visitor to Ukraine will fail to be struck by its many daily manifestations. Everywhere you go, Ukrainians speak Western languages, particularly English, in seemingly ever greater numbers.Ukraine tends to be depicted as an uneasy amalgam of two national communities: one in the country’s western regions, defined by Ukrainian ethnicity and language, the other in its Russophone east and south. If this was ever wholly accurate, it is no longer. To take one example, any visitor to Ukraine’s eastern and southern front lines will encounter soldiers who speak to one another in Russian and may not even know Ukrainian. But they see themselves as citizens of Ukraine committed to preventing Russia from subordinating their homeland — a cause for which they are prepared to die.

But that gigantic entertainment venue — which doubles as the world’s biggest screen — is also something else: a symbol of the coming collision between our climate goals and our seemingly insatiable appetite for stuff.In the 1990s, when multicolor LED lights were invented by Japanese scientists after decades of research, the hope was that they would help to avert climate catastrophe by greatly reducing the amount of electricity we use. It seemed perfectly intuitive. After all, LED lights use 90 percent less energy and last around 18 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
52;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/opinion/environment/climate-change-death-toll.html;Opinion | Just How Many People Will Die From Climate Change?;How deadly could climate change be? Last fall, in an idiosyncratic corner of the internet where I happen to spend a lot of time, an argument broke out about how to quantify and characterize the mortality impact of global warming. An activist named Roger Hallam — a founder of Extinction Rebellion who now helps lead the harder-line group Just Stop Oil — had told the BBC that, if global temperatures reach two degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average, “mainly richer humans will be responsible for killing roughly one billion mainly poorer humans.”Hallam was quoting from a somewhat obscure paper, published by an engineer and a musicologist and focused less on climate impacts than on climate justice. The claim was quickly picked apart by experts: “An oft-quoted adage within the climate-modeler community is that garbage in equals garbage out,” the climate advocate Mark Lynas wrote. “Getting the science right will strengthen rather than weaken the case for climate activism, both in the public mind and in court.”These are inarguable principles, and I don’t think it’s right to suggest that reaching two degrees of warming (which now looks very likely) will mean a billion people dead. Certainly that isn’t scientific consensus. But it did make me wonder: How big would the number have to be to strike you as really big? And how small to seem acceptable?I ask because many more rigorous estimates, while lower, are still quite shocking. Some calculations run easily into the tens of millions. If you include premature deaths from the air pollution produced by the burning of fossil fuels, you may well get estimates stretching into the hundreds of millions. These are all speculations, of course. Estimating climate mortality involves a huge range of calculations and projections, all of which are shrouded by large clouds of uncertainty — it’s literally a climate-scale puzzle, with billions of human variables and many more political and environmental ones, and settling on a number also requires separating the additional impact of warming from the ongoing mortality produced by social and environmental systems running continuously in the background today.

The reason, she said, was that Alvin L. Bragg, Manhattan’s Democratic district attorney, could not be trusted to keep Mr. Almansoori behind bars. Mr. Bragg, she said, is too lenient on “violent criminals.”The case was swiftly swept up into national politics, where both prosecutors have played major roles, prompting a volley of bitter cross-country exchanges.In a radio interview Thursday, Ms. Mitchell criticized Mr. Bragg’s handling of a case involving seven migrants arrested in New York City and charged with assaulting two police officers in Times Square last month. Four were initially released before appearing in court. All seven are now in jail.

Two sales over three days featuring the celebrated musician’s belongings rocketed to $14.4 million, with auction-house fees, outperforming the high estimate of $11.3 million.Bidders vied for silver leather platform boots the singer wore throughout the 1970s (they sold for $94,000, more than nine times the high estimate) and an 18-karat gold Rolex watch with a leopard-print dial (it fetched $176,400, about three times the high estimate).Over two and a half weeks, John and his husband, David Furnish, will offload around 900 items they collected over the decades and lived with in their Atlanta home. Most of the remaining auctions will take place online through Feb. 28, including sales of John’s celebrity portraits, jewelry and Versace clothes. With six online sales to go, the collection has already exceeded the original (and perhaps conservative) expectation of $10 million set by Christie’s.

Atlanta. Birmingham. There are certain American cities that are known for Black history. But African American history and culture can, of course, be found across the United States, in seemingly unlikely cities, like Portland, Maine, say, or Providence, R.I.Many of these places are included in the National Park Service’s Network to Freedom Program, which was created by the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998 and whose mission is to preserve and promote sites with a verifiable connection to the Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionists who helped fugitive slaves escape to freedom. There are currently more than 700 Network to Freedom locations across 39 states, in addition to Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Many are in the Northeast, a region that is not always strongly associated with Black history.Curiosity about these lesser-known destinations is how I found myself on the road to Auburn and Rochester, N.Y., the homes of two American heroes: Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.

They can be a bellwether for the Oscars, happening this year on March 10. (Since 1996, 83 of the 112 stars and films that won Oscars for best picture or acting first won a SAG Award.)This year’s ceremony is shaping up to be a “Barbenheimer” rematch: The two summer blockbusters — “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s biopic about the physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb, and “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig’s unique spin on the Mattel doll — each picked up a pack-leading four nominations and will be competing for the guild’s top prize, best ensemble.

Such is life when you transcend the role of designer and become more like a divining rod that indicates which way the cultural water is flowing. And that is?Toward “history,” she said as her co-creative director, Raf Simons, sipped Prosecco beside her. Or to be specific, toward the way history teaches us about where we are going. As Mr. Simons said in a news release later, “You can only realize your future if you know your past.”It’s not a blinding insight — if we don’t learn from our actions, we are doomed to repeat them, and so on — but at this particular time, when it often feels like we actually are repeating them and memories are awfully short, it’s worth a reminder (as Mrs. Prada said backstage). Besides, fashion can bring the point to life as well as any lecture. Maybe better.History has been much in the air in Milan. Maybe it’s because it was two years ago this week that Russia invaded Ukraine, or because the American presidential election feels like it’s dangerously on rewind. Maybe it’s because history-based films like “The Zone of Interest” and “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Oppenheimer” are sweeping the awards season, which parallels the ready-to-wear season. Or maybe it’s as simple as the fact that history is a living thing in fashion, given how many European houses are concerned with preserving their own heritages, constantly looking backward to define their identities. Probably all of the above.
61;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/arts/television/avatar-last-airbender-review-netflix.html;‘Avatar: The Last Airbender’: Been There, Saved That;Nickelodeon’s 2005 series “Avatar: The Last Airbender” was a sprawling odyssey that combined intricate world-building, meticulous references to Asian and Native cultures, lively humor and sharply plotted drama, all animated in a charming, anime-inspired style. It was an unqualified success, attracting millions of viewers and heaps of critical praise. The series introduced a world so rich, complete and full of its own histories and myths and traditions that it never needed a follow-up.But we know that’s not how things work.In 2010 there was the famously whitewashed live-action film “The Last Airbender,” which was, deservedly, met with a ferocious torrent of fan-fury. The sequel series, “Avatar: The Legend of Korra,” was more in touch with the original, but still unnecessary. And the same can be said for Netflix’s “Avatar: The Last Airbender,” the streamer’s latest big money, live-action adaptation that proves just how difficult it is to capture the magic of a beloved original.Like the original series, Netflix’s “Avatar: The Last Airbender” also takes place in a fictional Eastern world of four nations: Air Nomads, Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation. In this world a select group of people from each nation are “benders,” able to manipulate their element. For a century the Fire Nation has waged a winning war against the others — during which time the only hope for peace, the avatar, the sole master of all four elements, disappeared. When two Water Tribe siblings, Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), discover the prodigal avatar, a 12-year-old Air Nomad named Aang (Gordon Cormier), the three embark on a journey to complete Aang’s training so they can save the world from the threat of the Fire Nation.This “Avatar” attempts to condense several story lines, many of which are spread out across dozens of episodes in the robust sprawl of the original, into a tight eight episodes. Some of the economies the adaptation uses in fusing certain narratives — making new connections and throughlines among stories that were originally set in different locales, for example — are neatly done. And thanks to the involvement of the creators, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, each subplot, even when moved or modified, remains faithful, if not exactly in detail then absolutely in spirit, to that of its animated counterpart. The show is also full of carefully placed Easter eggs from the original. Something as minor as a background character’s passing mention of the Avatar encountering some “canyon crawlers” in an episode will immediately clue fans in to the dangerous beasts Team Avatar faced in Episode 11 of the Nickelodeon version.

What is a zine?The curators of “Copy Machine Manifestos: Artists Who Make Zines” at the Brooklyn Museum, the art historians Branden Joseph and Drew Sawyer, define them as low-budget, limited-circulation publications (short for “magazine” or “fanzine”) that are not political pamphlets or countercultural newspapers.The show’s territory starts in 1969, coinciding with the widening availability of photocopy machines, and runs to the present. The selection of zines, posters, films, videos, paintings, garments and other curios is pretty great, and you see many repeat visitors (like myself) wandering the galleries.

The ruling delivers a significant blow to the NCAA’s attempts to stop universities and their supporters from paying athletes to play at their schools.Judge Clifton L. Corker issued the ruling on Friday, writing that “while the NCAA permits student-athletes to profit from their NIL, it fails to show how the timing of when a student-athlete enters such an agreement would destroy the goal of preserving amateurism.”The judge agreed that maintaining competitive balance is a legitimate endeavor, but spreading competition evenly to NCAA-member schools “by restraining trade” is “precisely the type of anticompetitive conduct the Sherman Act seeks to prevent.”AdvertisementEarlier this month, Corker ruled that the states did not demonstrate the “requisite irreparable harm” that would require a temporary restraining order to be issued. In that decision, the judge did note that the plaintiffs were still likely to win the case.On Jan. 31, the states of Tennessee and Virginia filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in a federal district court, challenging the organization’s ban on using NIL inducements in recruiting. The suit came the day after news broke that the NCAA was investigating the recruiting activities of University of Tennessee and Spyre Sports — a collective unofficially associated with Volunteers athletics — specifically around quarterback Nico Iamaleava.The NCAA responded to the lawsuit by arguing that the states had no case for temporarily invalidating the NCAA’s rules, in part because Tennessee’s own state law bars NIL inducements in recruiting. The NCAA has also argued that the purpose of injunctive relief from a court is to preserve the status quo, and the NCAA’s rules are already the status quo.The attorneys general argue that Tennessee’s state law, cited by the NCAA, does bar pay-for-play but allows recruits to have conversations with collectives about NIL opportunities, which is banned by the NCAA.This story will be updated.(Photo: Mitchell Layton / Getty Images)

Substitute tofu for paneer if you like, the mildness of either lends itself well to this unexpectedly luxurious dish that is so much more than the sum of its parts.

I had a problem with the rice though, as it wasn’t cooked when the salmon was. When you cook the rice the first time, it says the water should be “almost” gone. That’s not very specific. My advice is to cook the rice separately on the stove. That way you can control the cook times for the salmon and the rice and not have to hope they come out at the same time. We ate the salmon and let the rice cook a bit longer. Not ideal to eat in stages.Is this helpful? 16

It’s inspired by the cavatelli with sausage and browned sage butter at Frankies 457 Spuntino in Brooklyn — the most ordered dish on dates, according to the owners, but appealing no matter the occasion, according to us. The key to making the dish sing is the unsexy color (brown). Youll want to get a hard sear on the sausage and the squash, and let the butter bubble until brown and toasty. If you’re looking for a vegetarian option, omit the sausage. The meat will be gone, but the comfort wont be.

This no-cook dish is a handy one to have up your sleeve, especially for warm evenings when the desire to cook is nonexistent. Silky soft tofu is draped in a punchy soy dressing, creating a lively dish with little effort. The tofu is ideally served cold, but 10 minutes at room temperature can take the edge off. Make it your own with other fresh herbs such as Thai basil, mint or shiso leaves, or add crunch with fried shallots or roasted peanuts. A salty, fermented element like kimchi, pickled radish or ja choi, also known as zha cai, a Sichuan pickled mustard root, would work well, too. One block of silken tofu is usually enough to feed two people, but for a more substantial meal, serve it with hot rice or noodles to create a pleasing contrast of temperatures.To get vegetarian recipes like this one delivered to your inbox, sign up for The Veggie newsletter .

Since garlic chips can burn easily, the key here is to combine the garlic and oil in an unheated pan for even cooking. As the oil heats up, the garlic will sizzle rapidly as the moisture cooks off. When it slows down, the garlic slices should be crisp. Be sure to remove the chips just as they begin to turn golden, as they will continue to cook after being removed from the oil. The rest is easy: Sauté the eggplant, create a quick soy sauce glaze, sprinkle with herbs and garlic chips, and serve.

Variations abound, but traditionally, tôm rim is made by marinating whole, unpeeled shrimp in fish sauce, palm sugar, pepper, garlic and shallot, then sautéing until the shrimp cooks through and the sauce becomes glossy and caramelized. This version, which is adapted from “Vietnamese Home Cooking” (Ten Speed Press, 2012) by chef Charles Phan, calls for weeknight-friendly peeled shrimp, and builds upon the dish’s classic flavor profile by introducing chile, lemongrass and ginger. Mr. Phan uses a homemade roasted chile paste that is heady with Sichuan peppercorns, ground bean paste and soy sauce, but he suggests store-bought roasted chile paste or chile-bean sauce for ease. You could swap in Sriracha, increase the garlic, apply these flavors to different proteins or even vegetables. Once you’ve understood the foundation of a dish, its potential is infinite. —Alexa Weibel

Add the onion, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just softened in texture and color, 3 to 4 minutes. Push the onion slices to the sides of the skillet, then add the chicken so that each piece has contact with the pan. (It’s OK if it’s crowded.) Cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is browned and releases easily from the skillet, 7 to 8 minutes more. Use tongs to flip the chicken and scatter the apricots around the skillet.

The sweet citrus, creamy avocado and earthy beets are really all you need, but trio can serve as a base for salads all year long. Add protein (fresh or tinned seafood, grains, legumes), dairy (burrata, stracciatella, yogurt, feta), more vegetables or fruits (baby greens, chicories, radishes, cucumbers), and flavor boosters like toasted whole spices or nuts, crushed red pepper, herbs, shallots or olives. The beets can be steamed or roasted, or you can purchase them precooked. Any way you make it, this easy-to-assemble salad is a bright, beautiful spot in winter’s shorter, darker days.

It’s comforting with its buttery softness and complex with its blend of five extracts (vanilla, rum, coconut, lemon and almond). The celebrity chef Carla Hall got this recipe, among other beloved soul food dishes, from her maternal grandmother, Jessie Mae Price. This family dessert was served at every Christmas celebration in Tennessee and wrapped and shipped off to the grandchildren as well. It’s a keeping cake, the kind that tastes even better over time, and meant to be shared. Ms. Hall wanted to recreate the tenderness that her granny achieved through sifted cake flour without sending home cooks to the store for yet another ingredient, so she swapped in some cornstarch instead. If you don’t have that in your pantry, using only all-purpose flour works just fine too, as does any combination of extracts you can find or have on hand. —Genevieve Ko

Everything is tossed with tangy-sweet raisins (or your favorite dried fruit), more red onion that’s been quick-pickled in lime juice, a green mound of arugula and parsley leaves. It’s a bright, satisfying salad that works as a substantial side dish or a light main course, either rounded out with crusty bread or served on top of a bed of rice, farro or other grains.

Michele Baldacci, the chef and co-owner, recommends a mixture of white and red onions for a more delicate, saucy result, and cooking them in a covered pot so they slowly braise in olive oil and their own juices. The sweetness of the onions is accented by tarragon and black pepper, plus optional grated cheese (which can be omitted for vegan diners). “We never add anything [else], we’re boring,” Mr. Baldacci said, but reckons livers would be delicious. —Ali Slagle

To keep the recipe as streamlined as possible, the pistachio flavor comes from melted ice cream, plus some chopped pistachios in the crust for a crunchy, nutty pop. The brand of ice cream you use makes a huge difference: The more like real pistachios it tastes, the better the cheesecake. (Some brands of pistachio use extracts and flavorings instead of actual pistachio nuts, check the ingredients before buying.) You can make the cheesecake up to 5 days in advance and keep it in the fridge until ready to top with raspberries and serve.

Coax deep, nutty flavors from cauliflower and a whole head of garlic by roasting them until caramelized, next you’ll simmer them until nearly falling apart, then blend the mixture until silky-smooth. Gentle and comforting on its own, the soup can also serve as the start to your own creation: You could roast sliced onions or leeks instead of the garlic, stir in Cheddar, Gruyère or Parmesan, or top with fried sage or capers. Accompany with grilled cheese or pumpernickel bread, or a hearty salad with grains or lentils.
93;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025110-one-pot-creamy-chicken-and-noodles;One-Pot Creamy Chicken and Noodles Recipe;Think of this warming dish as a relay race, each ingredient handing its flavor to the next. During the (almost!) hands-off cooking, a head of garlic and a whole chicken stuffed with a Parmesan rind roast, then give themselves to salted water, which in turn flavors the egg noodles that soften around the bird. Salt and water are your best tools here: Season the chicken, season the water and season both again. Don’t hesitate to add more water as the noodles are cooking to make sure they’re submerged. Every brand will absorb a slightly different amount of liquid, and you want a result that’s splashy enough to take on all the Parmesan you will grate at the table. Use your largest pot so everything fits. A 7- to 9-quart Dutch oven has ideal proportions with its wide base and chicken-height sides. You can substitute any short, quick-cooking pasta for egg noodles, and introduce sautéed mushrooms, spinach or herbs at the end, if that’s your mood.

Like many I was concerned the recipe was incorrect about how long to cook the gnocchi but in the end I followed it as written and that was the right choice. The small amount of broth at a bare simmer cooks the gnocchi very slowly. The chard & young mustard greens were soft after 12 minutes & after 5 more to warm the peas it all came together. The sauce is silky and rich with a tang. Serve with crusty bread to sop it up. Don’t skip the ricotta it adds another dimension. A keeper!Is this helpful? 184

Skin-on Yukon Golds are thinly sliced, fanned out and generously drizzled with a citrus sauce to serve as the base for the meal. The salmon is placed directly on top of the potatoes after they’re briefly roasted, the fish is drizzled with more sauce, then everything roasts together until the salmon is tender and the potatoes are perfectly cooked through and irresistibly tangy. Feel free to swap out the cilantro for any fresh herb you prefer, such as dill or parsley.

It’s also vegan, and perfect for a fall evening. Use a mixture of cultivated mushrooms, they come in all shapes and sizes. Look for royal trumpets, a large, meaty type of oyster mushroom, shiitakes, and small portobellos. Use some wild mushrooms too, if you can, like golden chanterelles, lobster or hen of the woods. You can make this as spicy as you wish, but be sure to include some cayenne and green chile, to complement and play off the creamy coconut milk sauce. Serve with basmati rice, rice noodles or mashed potatoes. —David Tanis

Minestrone — vegetables, beans and pasta — shouldn’t be too strict and this recipe can be used as a guide. Cabbages become plentiful in cold weather and are celebrated in this dish, used first to flavor the soup, then whizzed into a pesto to spoon on top. Spinach can be swapped for chard, pasta for rice, black beans for chickpeas or other beans, just take account of any necessary adjustments to their cook times. This version uses black beans (as opposed to more traditional cannellini or borlotti beans) for their small size and rich flavor. They nestle nicely among the other vegetables without dominating the soup, adding wonderful nuttiness and depth alongside the cabbage.
98;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024755-miyar-taushe-lamb-and-squash-stew;Miyar Taushe (Lamb and Squash Stew) Recipe;Stew is a luxury because it demands what we seem to have the least of these days: time. When making miyar taushe (also known as miyan taushe), this earthy-sweet stew from northern Nigeria, you stand vigil while lamb simmers on the stove, slowly coming undone, and butternut squash softens in the oven, its skin ready to cave in. The squash is rendered velvety in a blender, with a dusting of calabash nutmeg — woodsier and mustier than regular nutmeg — then united with the lush lamb stock. Yemisi Aribisala, a Nigerian writer and the author of “Longthroat Memoirs: Soups, Sex and Nigerian Taste Buds” (Cassava Republic Press, 2016), notes that the pot should be big enough so the stew reaches only halfway up, because it splatters. At the end, you deliver to your guests bowls of tamed sun, hot, creamy, melty, thick and earthy-sweet. —Ligaya Mishan

It’s also said to bring good luck and good fortune to those who eat it. Ozoni is highly customizable, but it must always contain pieces of chewy mochi. The rice cakes are traditionally pounded by hand, but are now sold already prepared and are easy to find in Japanese markets around the New Year. This Japanese American version from the chef Chris Ono includes pork belly that simmers in a mix of dashi, soy sauce, sake and ginger until tender. To balance that richness, he serves this soup with lots of mizuna leaves, which can easily be substituted with spinach. For those who believe pork is unlucky at New Years, it can easily be left out or substituted with chicken. —Khushbu Shah

Feel free to swap the sweet potato for pumpkin or any winter squash — this soup is versatile — and use small pasta shapes like orzo if you don’t have bulgur on hand.

There are many versions of this peasant food, including ones with pancetta, carrots, parsley or Parmesan rinds, some also use a hodgepodge of pasta shapes from half-empty boxes — it’s a true pantry meal. Brown lentils will fall apart more quickly than green, but they’ll create a luscious sauce either way. Stir the pasta often, especially towards the end of cooking, and add more water if the pot is dry (the sauce will thicken as it cools). Leftovers will keep for up to 3 days refrigerated, warm over low heat and add water to loosen.

Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. It’s adapted from Millie Peartree, the owner of Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food restaurant in the Bronx, who has been making this dish since she was a little girl. The recipe was passed down in her family for generations, but because of the generous amount of cheese used, the dish was only made for events like Christmas and Thanksgiving. Extra-sharp Cheddar adds tartness and a layer of Colby Jack creates a gooey, molten center. If you can’t find a Colby Jack blend, shredded mozzarella or a Mexican-style blend will work in its place. —Kiera Wright-Ruiz

Green cabbage (though you could also use Savoy) becomes jammy and sweet when cooked with aromatic leeks and garlic for 15 minutes, a practically effortless concoction to toss with pasta. Cumin seeds add just the right amount of earthiness along with a subtle citrus tone, add more if you want a pronounced flavor, or substitute with fennel seeds or caraway. The walnuts balance out the sweetness of the cabbage and leeks, and introduce a slight bitterness and crunch. Store-bought roasted walnuts are a time saver here, but if you want them extra dark and crispy, toast them for 6 to 8 minutes in a 325-degree oven until deeply golden. If you have chives or scallions on hand, toss these in at the end for a lively finish.

Sautéed onions do double duty: They serve as a thickener and help offset the sweetness of the cashews. This simple stovetop pasta is wonderful on its own, but feel free to add roasted vegetables, fresh herbs, spices, harissa or hot sauce. For a quick-baked version worthy of Thanksgiving dinner, pile the prepared mac and cheese into a casserole dish, top with panko and more nutritional yeast, and broil for a few minutes until golden brown.

One full pound of fresh spinach is cooked down in garlicky butter before cream is added, then simmered until thickened. The cooked pasta is added directly to the sauce, then tossed with ricotta cheese for even more richness. Fettuccine or tagliatelle pasta work best, but the creamy sauce will cling to any long noodles. Top with pine nuts, walnuts or hazelnuts for crunch, or leave the nuts out entirely.

There are a few different ways of making it, including stuffing the eggplants with a paste of peanuts, coconut and sesame seeds. This version minimizes tedium by skipping that step and using peanut butter instead of freshly ground peanuts. Whole mustard seeds bring texture and a delicious bitterness.

Bring to a boil over high, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 2 to 4 hours. You may have to add more water during the cooking process. The beans should be very tender and somewhat brothy. A few minutes before they are done, remove and discard the thyme sprigs, bay leaves and rinds, then crush some of the beans against the side of the pot to thicken the broth.

While sweet potato fries won’t crisp up as much as their potato counterparts, that’s part of the appeal, offering textural contrast of creamy centers and charred tips. Oomph from any of your favorite spices would work well here, along with the paprika. Sumac could add a punch of brightness or a dash of cayenne can impart some heat. If your air fryer basket is larger, try a bigger sweet potato for a higher serving — but don’t overfill it with sweet potatoes, or they’ll steam rather than crisping in spots.

The heat is highly circulated in an air fryer hence how it is like frying, but with air.

Canned pickled jalapeños are the magic ingredient here by adding heat and vinegary tang to both the cakes and the accompanying mayonnaise. (Any leftover sauce would be delicious as a dip for shrimp or with any simply cooked fish.) Canned salmon works well here, too, just be sure to buy the boneless, skinless variety. Finally, when you’re cooking the cakes, keep an eye on the heat level, hovering between medium and medium-low once the oil heats up. If the oil gets scorching hot, kernels of corn may start to pop and splatter. A quick dip in seasoned flour also helps prevent this, providing a barrier between the cakes and the oil and ensuring the cakes come out nice and crispy.

The recipe comes from Naoko Takei Moore, who co-authored “Donabe: Classic and Modern Japanese Clay Pot Cooking” with Kyle Connaughton (Ten Speed Press, 2015) and created Toiro, a Los Angeles shop that specializes in donabe and Japanese cookware. It’s intended to be cooked in a donabe, a Japanese clay pot prized for its ability to retain heat and cook evenly, but also works well in a Dutch oven or other pot. Once you’ve stirred together your miso sauce, seasoned your salmon and prepped your vegetables, the meal comes together with little effort, as you layer the vegetables, dashi, salmon and sauce in your pot then simmer until tender. Organize your prepped ingredients and the practice of cooking this dish feels as soul-soothing as the results. —Alexa Weibel

Now I use mayonnaise as the base for nearly every marinade I use, whether I’m cooking on the grill or in a cast-iron skillet indoors. The magic of mayo is that it helps your other marinade ingredients spread evenly across the surface of the meat, delivering more consistent flavor, while improving browning. (Don’t worry, the cooked meat doesn’t taste like mayo.) In this recipe, that means chicken cutlets that cook through and brown in about four minutes, with deep chimichurri flavor enhanced by a post-grill drizzle of fresh sauce. This recipe will work with nearly any marinade, exactly as written: You could use pesto, salsa verde, bottled barbecue sauce, jarred Thai curry paste, teriyaki sauce or mole, all with equal success.

Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyère and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too.

I made them exactly by the recipe except I used a slightly larger pan (by mistake) - and they came out very flat, not chewy at all and not moist in the center. I only baked them for 18 minutes. Was it just the size of the pan or could it have been something else? Generally brownies have more eggs, less flour and more baking soda or powder than this recipe calls for. Any help will be appreciated!Is this helpful? 1

138;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/46-how-to-use-an-instant-pot;How to Use an Instant Pot;How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers — stovetop and electric — are quite safe. They don’t explode as your grandmother’s may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, they’re heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pot’s temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isn’t hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cook’s having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And don’t worry: It won’t explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.

Maxar美国政府报告和独立专家一直在就罗布泊的旧核试验基地提出不太明确的担忧。这些报告称该基地可能准备全年运作，其活动也“缺乏透明度”。但如今越来越多的卫星图像显示，这一军事基地出现了一些新的钻孔——适合在大型核爆中用于抑制致命放射性火焰的喷发，还进行了大量升级和扩建。罗布泊核试验场（有时被称为马兰基地）的主基地是一处由建筑群和技术场站构成的大型综合体，面积超过3平方公里。自2017年以来，这里新建或翻新了30多座建筑。 这条西南方向的公路长约120公里，通往一处老试验区。卫星图像显示，罗布泊东部地区出现了许多新修土路。 在山脉一侧挖掘的平洞以前曾用于核武器测试。卫星图像显示，最近至少有一条地道有过挖掘和施工的痕迹。 这处高度戒备的设施中包括了地下掩体和防护围栏，符合烈性爆炸物与核装置的处理要求。 卫星图像显示，该基地的现有路网中最近多了几条新路，延伸约50公里，可达东部山区的一处新址。 其他卫星图像则揭示了隐藏于山间的钻机，这可能是将在未来投入使用的地下试验区。相较于以前那些较浅的平洞，新开发区域的深井能够支持更大规模的核试验。 以下是对最近这些发现的详细分析。 The New York Times, satellite images by Planet Labs“所有证据都表明，中国正在为恢复核试验做准备，”卡内基国际和平基金会的核专家赵通说。新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯武器实验室前主任齐格弗里德·赫克说，罗布泊的重建很不寻常。“俄罗斯人和美国人也在继续试验场的活动，”他说，“但跟这是两码事。”分析人士表示，罗布泊的活动标志着中国核设施的广泛现代化。他们警告称，这可能会加速军备建设，引发一个新的核竞争时代。他们还说，中国和其他核大国的举动可能会破坏1996年开始的全球禁试协议。冷战结束后，世界核大国签署了该条约，以遏制代价高昂、逐渐失控的核军备竞赛。关于罗布泊的新证据是由五角大楼下属的国家地理空间情报局的前分析师雷尼·巴比亚尔兹发现的，他是卫星侦察和北京核计划方面的专家，他说，在深井中进行爆炸可能加快对新型核武器的完善，以满足中国快速增长的武器库。查看了卫星图像和巴比亚尔兹的分析报告的独立专家也有同样的担忧。罗布泊的活动正值美中关系最为敏感的时刻。美国总统拜登表示，他正试图“稳定”两国日益不和的关系，并在去年11月与中国领导人习近平举行的峰会上寻求某种程度的和解。美国情报官员表示，多年来他们一直在关注罗布泊的重新启用。他们说，虽然建筑工程很明显，但其目的并不明显。他们承认，中国可能正在为核试验做准备。中国外交部在声明中回应了有关罗布泊升级的问题，称其为“捕风捉影，毫无根据地制造中国核威胁”，称这种说法“完全不负责任”。外交部还强调了北京遵守核试验禁令的承诺，并补充说，这一立场“赢得了国际社会的高度赞扬”。声明说，中国将“不遗余力地实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高愿望”。一个侦探和他的发现前情报分析员巴比亚尔兹的博士论文写的是中国核计划的起源。他现在管理着一家民用卫星图像分析公司的运营部门，同时在约翰·霍普金斯大学教授一门关于地理空间分析的课程，最近还与人合著了一本关于卫星图像解读的教科书。雷尼·巴比亚尔兹在佛蒙特州的家中。 John Tully for The New York Times从政府部门离职后，巴比亚尔兹花了很多时间分析罗布泊的卫星图像。在做评估时，他不仅查看了最新的图像，还翻出早期图像，它们提供了罗布泊基地发展的直观历史。在今年的一份报告中，他详细记录了一个占地约26平方公里的新试验区。巴比亚尔兹说，这片贫瘠的土地上有很深的钻孔，还有新的公路、输电线、一个变电站和一个有多座建筑物的支持区。2021年8月

Maxar“总体迹象表明，他们正在准备进行试验，”他在接受采访时说。罗布泊位于中国西部干旱的新疆地区，是一片广阔的军事基地，面积与弗吉尼亚州相当。按照中国的说法，在这里进行核试验是因为它非常贫瘠，与世隔绝，没有任何常住居民。但其所在的新疆地区是以穆斯林为主的维吾尔族人的家园，近些年他们遭受了大规模的拘禁，以及无处不在的监控。维吾尔族人长期以来一直抗议在这里进行核试验对健康的威胁。1964年，毛泽东决定研发原子弹后，这里开始进行核试验。早期的试验给这里的天空带来蘑菇云和放射性沉降物。1969年，中国进行了首次地下核试验。起初，北京使用的是较浅的平洞。中国相对较晚开始钻凿深度足以可靠抑制致命辐射的竖井，尤其是针对大型的爆炸。1978年，中国进行了首次竖井核试验。毛泽东曾说过原子弹是“纸老虎”的名言。因此，中国建设的核武库曾小于法国和英国核力量的总和。冷战结束后，罗布泊核试验场停止了大型核爆炸试验，变得相对冷清。2012年习近平上台后，这种情况开始改变。这名中国领导人将他在2015年底成立的火箭军视为功绩之一。这支负责管理中国核武器的精锐部队体现了习近平的雄心壮志，他要把中国提升为一个受尊重、令人恐惧的大国，随时准备与美国抗衡。事实证明，习近平的政治崛起与罗布泊的重生是并行的。罗布泊的秘密活动的公开是由于现在有了新的公开监视手段。绕地球运行的最强大的民用成像卫星可以分辨地面上直径小至30厘米的物体。分析人士说，从数百公里高的地方，这种航天器和它携带的望远镜可以辨别出人、车辆类型，甚至飞机的注册编号。巴比亚尔兹对民用图像的分析讲述了一个罗布泊升级换代的故事。到2017年，一处只有几栋建筑的旧址变成了一组漂亮的超现代建筑群，四周修建了防护栏。新建筑包括一个由土堤和避雷器保护的掩体，使其成为处理烈性爆炸物的理想场所。2021年5月

Maxar这处地点引起了怀疑，但情况尚不明朗。核武器使用常规炸药来启动连锁反应。但亚临界核试验也是如此，也就是全球禁止核试验条约允许的规模较小的试验。巴比亚尔兹谨慎地表示，该建筑群可能是准备核装置的场所。到2018年，罗布泊的下一个大项目是一处大型空军基地的快速扩建，它的主跑道近5公里长。卫星图像显示，有十几座大型建筑正在建设中。2021年8月 未完工的跑道 已铺设跑道 主要保障区 第二保障区

Maxar与此同时，特朗普政府在2018年宣布，“美国必须随时做好恢复核试验的准备”。2019年，中国外交部批评美国不仅破坏了核试验禁令，而且破坏了“全球战略安全与稳定”。即便如此，特朗普的高级官员还是在2020年5月讨论了重启核试验的好处。会议消息遭到泄露。不久之后，参议院军事委员会的共和党人批准了1000万美元的拨款，以缩短进行一次核试验所需的时间。随着紧张局势的加剧，巴比亚尔兹发现，中国已经开始改造和扩大罗布泊试验区——最初是这里的平洞。这些相当浅的坑道冷战期间进行过小当量的试爆。2020年的卫星图像显示，一条主坑道正在进行大规模的挖掘和建设工作，其入口被卡车、推土机和挖出的成堆泥土包围。2021年8月

Maxar但与警备严密的地方一样，这些平洞的用途并不明确，这些岩洞的深度足以用来吸收小型原子弹或大型亚临界核试验爆炸的冲击波。但后来意外地出现了更加令人不安的线索。巴比亚尔兹在2021年初仔细观察罗布泊的新卫星图像时注意到了一些大型的修路设备：一台平地机和一台前端装载机。“它们出现在荒无人烟的地方，”他回忆道。2021年4月 新铺整型土路 前端装载机 可能是平地机 2021年4月 新铺整型土路

Maxar巴比亚尔兹顺着这条新路查看下去。这条路长约十几公里，从一片数十年前用于竖井爆炸的平坦地带延伸至一处正在快速发展的山区。在一片迷宫般的峡谷中，他惊讶地发现了一座正在架设的大型钻机。该钻机高约27米。那是2021年7月。次月，他在新获得的图像中不仅看到了钻机井架，还看到了大量的钻杆和旁边的一个润滑剂深坑，钻头往更深处钻洞时需要润滑剂。巴比亚尔兹从这些线索估计出，钻出的洞深至少有500米。2021年8月

Maxar“主要的是，那里相当忙，”巴比亚尔兹在谈到该军事基地时说。咄咄逼人和边缘政策核武器专家说，他们没有看到中国即将进行核试验的迹象，并提出理由说中国也许不做什么。重建军事基地可能只是向西方发出的一种警告，他们说。中国的专家们已发表过类似的看法。习近平已在2023年7月更换了火箭军的最高层将领。 Li Gang/Xinhua中国是否进行核试验可能也取决于其对手的行动。俄罗斯最近发出的信号、以及美国政府早些时候发出的信号也许会让中国政府担忧。经常访问中国并与中国最好的科学家保持交流的著名核物理学家理查德·L·加尔文说，重建罗布泊试验场代表着一种技术上的下注。“他们不想在别人走在前面时毫无准备，”他说。卡内基基金会的专家赵通同意这个说法：“中国觉得有必要为最坏的情况做准备。”桑迪亚国家实验室前主任斯蒂芬·M·杨格说，中国单方面进行核试验，以此来表明态度，并非不可想象之事。一些分析人士认为，中国也许没进行大型核爆的计划，而是在逐步增加本国的亚临界试验项目，这种试验不会产生自持链式反应。俄罗斯和美国都用这类试验来评估本国的现有核武库。有些专家不同意这个观点，他们认为中国新增的轰炸机、潜艇和导弹发射井都预示着中国将大力发展新军备。五角大楼已预测，按照中国目前的军力扩张速度，到2035年时，中国将有部署1500枚核弹头的能力。这个数字将让中国半个多世纪以来保持的“最小威慑”增加五倍。美国专家说，中国科学家目前正计划研发在他们看来是最适于这轮军备扩张的具体武器，并可能从核试验中学到很多东西。中国与美俄不同，后者在“冷战”期间进行过规模远大于中国的核试验。“我知道他们认为他们落在了后面，”洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室前主任特里·C·华莱士说，他长期从事对中国核试验计划的研究。“他们也许觉得他们在核试验知识上太落后，因此想采取非同寻常之举。”风险与回报的问题核试验让科学家能找到缺陷，从而改进新武器的设计。中国在“冷战”期间总共进行了45次核爆炸试验。相比之下，法国进行了210次，俄罗斯进行了715次，美国进行了1030次。虽然已有187个国家签署了禁止核试验条约，但由于中国、美国和其他六个国家没有批准，该条约从未生效。尽管如此，分析人士长期以来一直认为该条约有利于美国，因为它禁止与美国竞争的遵守条约国家提高自己核武库的先进性。专家们说，中国最想实现的是核武器小型化。有了能更准确地打击目标的新型导弹，科学家们能降低核弹头的爆炸当量、大小和成本。“他们有完全能用的核武器，”加尔文说，他在设计世界上第一颗氢弹上有功劳。“但他们可能想把武器小型化。”专家们说，核武器小型化能让中国的潜射导弹更具杀伤力。据外界判断，中国的潜射导弹最多可携带三枚核弹头。相比之下，美国的主要潜射导弹“三叉戟II型”最多可携带八个弹头。核武器小型化还能推动中国高超音速武器的研发，这种武器能迂回避开美国的防御系统。据五角大楼的说法，中国想让这些武器拥有核优势。去年秋天，全球公民社会的领导人曾警告说，禁止核试验条约面临着“日益严重的威胁”，并提出了加强禁止核试验条约的办法。中国官员迅速否认了所有核试验的计划，同时以更快的速度将矛头指向美国。“如果真正关心”禁止核试验条约的话，中国外交部在一份声明中说，就该“好好研究一下美国的核武库和核政策”。例如，中国的专家批评美国双重标准，一边支持全球禁止核试验，一边想方设法研发能够规避禁令的技术。2022年，美国科学家们宣布了在核聚变实验上取得的一项被称赞为向丰富清洁能源迈出了一步的重大进展。消息公布后的第二天，中共的民族主义小报《环球时报》专门提到该核聚变实验使用的巨型激光的一个鲜为人知的事实：它主要用于推动核武器发展。中国已在近来指出，美国自“冷战”以来设计的第一个新型核弹头W93目前正在研发中，这是美国核扩张的例证。美国军方说，这个创新武器不需要进行爆炸试验。尽管如此，中国的专家们仍把重启核试验的威胁描述为来自美国。去年9月，解放军退役军官腾建群在中国央视军事频道的一期节目中称，美国“试图突破核试验限制”。相比之下，美国的专家们则将罗布泊设施的现代化工程视为中国也许愿意在核武器项目上走多远的一个标志。“我们不得不认识到，他们曾经采取的保守立场正在改变，”洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室前主任华莱士说。

online scam compound in Myanmar. 尼奥·陆（音）对这份报酬丰厚的新工作充满期待。但是从抵达那一刻起，他就知道事情有蹊跷。 他没有被聘用。他是被绑架了，被迫参与恶劣的网络诈骗活动。只有理解了它的运转方式，才有希望逃脱出来。 在缅甸“杀猪盘”诈骗园区的七个月 一名男子被中国犯罪团伙拐卖并被迫在一个诈骗组织工作。他收集了财务信息、照片和视频，并与《纽约时报》分享了这些材料。他被许以丰厚的薪酬。更合理的工作时间安排。有机会在繁华大都市曼谷生活。招聘机构说，以他的英语能力，可以作为译员在一家电商公司大展拳脚。尤其重要的是，这位28岁的中国上班族相信，这份工作让他可以从头开始，为他移居西方的梦想攒钱。于是他在去年6月与身边的人道别，前往泰国从事他的新工作。然而抵达后，烈日照得他头昏脑涨——他感觉事情很不对劲。他没有来到城市里的写字楼，而是被丢在一个劳改营一样的地方，那是丛林和泥泞田地间的一些简易建筑。园区内很简陋，低矮的水泥房子上，门窗全都有栅栏。入口有两个穿迷彩服的男人手持步枪站岗。高高的围墙和篱笆顶端有铁丝网，显然除了防止外人闯入外，也是为了让里面的人出不去。园区的景象。尼奥·陆很快意识到，这其实不是一份翻译的工作。也不存在什么电商公司。这一切，从某中国招聘论坛上的贴文开始，都是人贩子精心布下的骗局，目的是把他这样的人骗到泰国。人贩子带着尼奥·陆渡过了莫伊河——那是形同虚设的泰国边境线上的一条混浊的河流——在他不知情的情况下把他弄到了缅甸的一个偏僻角落。在那里，他被交给出钱买下他的一个华人黑帮。尼奥·陆等于是被诱拐到了一个他完全陌生的地方，并卖给了犯罪团伙。他就这样成了被拐卖给犯罪团伙的数十万人中的一员，他们被困在这个充斥着剥削、暴力和欺诈的陷阱中无法脱身，一个研究组织称之为“犯罪肿瘤”。由于担心被犯罪分子报复，尼奥·陆选择电影《黑客帝国》(Matrix)中的人物作为自己的化名，他要求只在文中使用他的姓氏。通过采访他的父母和两个朋友，以及查阅短信、旅行文件副本和中国当局发布的信函，时报对他旅行、被囚禁和最终获救的情节进行了核实。他讲述的拐卖过程与其他在类似园区获救的人做出的陈述是相符的。他的经历以及他带出来的资料让我们有了一个难得的机会，可以从中了解到一个极其庞大的地下世界的运转方式和策略。这些团伙在柬埔寨、老挝和缅甸的基地强迫被他们囚禁的人去实施复杂的网络诈骗，其目标是世界各地的一些感到孤单、容易上当的人。通常这类骗术会使用虚假的网络身份，以引诱他人建立虚假的恋爱关系，然后通过伪造的加密货币骗局向他们骗取大量金钱。这样的骗术被称为“杀猪盘”，因为整个过程需要骗取目标的信任，这可能需要数周的时间——也就是所谓把猪养肥——然后才下杀手。很多被诱拐和强迫为诈骗团伙工作的是中国人，因为这些团伙一开始主要是骗在中国的人。不过他们的目标已经开始广布于世界各地。在美国，联邦调查局的报告称2022年美国人因“杀猪盘”及其它投资骗局导致的损失超过20亿美元。越来越多来自印度、菲律宾及其它十多个国家的人被拐卖并为诈骗团伙工作，以至于国际刑警组织宣布这个趋势构成了全球安全威胁。为了让被拐来的人就范，犯罪团伙会使用暴力和歪曲逻辑兼有的方式。那些不听话的人会遭到殴打。一旦开始做事，这些受害人往往会觉得他们已经成了从犯，如果回国就会坐牢。团伙往往会没收被拐卖者的护照，让他们的签证过期，从而制造移民方面的麻烦。尼奥·陆所在的团伙会把获得的利润分一小部分给工人，用于食物、赌博、毒品和性方面的开销，从而让恶劣的工作环境显得能忍受一些。有的团伙还会给奖励，有时候是加钱，有时候是许诺提供离开所需的旅行证件。“诈骗团伙需要让被拐卖的人有个幻觉，就是靠着努力工作可以离开这个系统，”陆说。“驴子原来是为了不被鞭子抽而向前走，最终会变成追逐在眼前晃的胡萝卜。”陆说他请求他们放了他，但遭到拒绝。他们让他做会计工作，几个月下来，他经手了数百万美元的非法收入，并管理他们的日常开销。尼奥·陆在给诈骗团伙当会计期间制作的一份电子表格，记录了2022年11月的开支和诈骗收入。陆在与《纽约时报》取得联系时还在园区内。他发出了数百页计的财务记录，以及园区的照片和视频，希望有朝一日能揭露这些罪行。他还发了一张地图的截图，标明了他在缅甸的大致位置。时报对该地区卫星图片进行分析，确定了他照片所在位置是一处已知的诈骗团伙园区，名叫东美园区。但到了1月，他失去了音讯。抵达“小中国”缅甸东南部的妙瓦底，也就是东美园区的所在地，为诱拐尼奥·陆的这类诈骗组织提供了完美的基地。政府在这里什么也做不了。暴徒们花钱雇人保护自己，在当地少数民族武装团体的支持下横行霸道。这样的条件吸引了中国犯罪团伙，导致非法赌场飞地纷纷涌现，贩毒和洗钱活动激增。尼泊尔 中国 印度 缅甸 老挝 妙瓦底 泰国 越南 孟加拉湾 柬埔寨 南海 中国 缅甸 老挝 妙瓦底 泰国 越南 柬埔寨美国当局说，东美园区的一个重要投资者是尹国驹，他是一名被定罪的中国黑帮犯罪分子，绰号“崩牙驹”。记者无法联系到尹国驹请其置评。据总部位于华盛顿的研究机构美国和平研究所估计，与东美园区同时出现的，是由中国诈骗团伙经营的十多个类似的非法开发项目。像尼奥·陆这样的人一旦被诱拐到缅甸，就会与家人和朋友断绝联系，这个地区基本上禁止外国人和媒体进入，也远离警察的控制范围。尼奥·陆称妙瓦底为“小中国”。2020年2月

Technologies在某些方面，东美区让他觉得很像一家中国工厂。工人们可以使用一家食堂、一家出售中国产品的便利店、一家中餐馆、一家名为“金马”的小赌场和一家卡拉OK吧。但它显然是围绕非法活动组织起来的。尼奥·陆说，冰毒、MDMA（又称摇头丸）和氯胺酮可以在游戏厅和卡拉OK厅买到，建筑群里一栋类似宿舍的建筑还兼做妓院。安保很严密，尤其是在园区周边。守卫在瞭望塔和大门口防止工人逃跑。莫伊河环绕着东美大部分地区。水泥墙 铁丝围栏 水泥墙 铁丝围栏 从尼奥·陆的窗户往外看，他住在诈骗组织租用的一栋大楼里。该组织的负责人是一位头发花白、眼睛鼓鼓的中年中国男子，大家都叫他“喜哥”。园区里没有人使用真名。尼奥·陆说，喜哥向东美园区租了这个地方，经营着大约有70人的生意，这些人当中，大多数是同样受困在妙瓦底的中国公民。尼奥·陆后来被告知，为了买他，喜哥向人贩子支付了3万美元。“杀猪盘”运作结构 员工

四名员工由于目标大多在中国，该组织将所有时钟调快一个半小时，以与北京时间保持一致。每天都显得漫长而艰苦：工作从上午10点半开始，到午夜结束，中间有三次休息，每次只休息半小时。工人们每个月只休息一天。他们坐在一间开放式的办公室里，受到主管们的严密监视。在一个房间里，工作人员使用排列在墙上的数百部手机，在中国流行的聊天应用微信上建立看似真实的个人档案。把窃取而来、通常是在网上批发购买的微信账号、手机号码、照片和视频等数据输入这些个人档案。这些工人每天都在使用微信，在每台设备上浏览社交媒体动态，模仿正常使用，以躲过应用程序的欺诈检测系统。尼奥·陆秘密拍摄的诈骗活动使用的账户农场、主要办公空间和部分空置的宿舍。尼奥·陆睡的房间里到处都是蠼螋，散发着恶臭，他和另外七名中国男子住在一起。躺在床上时，尼奥·陆会想，他怎么会偏离了自己曾经设想的生活。17岁时，他曾在英国的一所大学学习了一年工程学，但是因为学费太高，他在中国东部做小生意的父母不得不让他退学。他的情绪开始抑郁，进而变得焦躁不安。从那以后的几年里，他在阿曼、尼日利亚和肯尼亚的中国公司工作，但他渴望存到足够的钱供自己上大学，并且最终移居西方。在他看来，正是这个他一心想实现的愿景让他来到了缅甸。现在，他在一心想着如何逃脱。他知道自己需要帮助，但在到达园区时，他的手机就已经被主管没收了。在第一周，他用工作电话联系了一位使用即时通讯应用Telegram的朋友。第二天，主管们与他对质，威胁要打他，或者把他卖到妙瓦底的另一个营地，据说那里会摘取被贩卖工人的器官。尼奥·陆崩溃了，求他们放了他。“我干不了。我不是这块料。你们放我走吧！”他回忆自己当时对绑架他的人这么说。但是完全没有用。喜哥最后给了尼奥·陆三个选择：支付3万美元的赎金；像其他人一样当骗子；或者把他的技能派上用场，帮喜哥做会计。喜哥说，六个月后，黑帮会考虑释放他。尼奥·陆选择了会计。尼奥·陆将电费、办公室租金和佣金等费用记入账目。但他追踪到的其他款项是犯罪行业独有的。“茶水费”指的是支付给中间人的钱，让他们与人贩子联系。“过河费”包括偷运工人越过边境的费用。“派兵费”是支付给武装警卫护送人们进出营地的费用。“车队费”是指用于洗钱的资金。骗术如何操作喜哥团伙欺骗的主要是年龄在30岁到50岁之间、说中文的女性，最好已婚。一个小组主管负责批量购买个人数据，从中确定可能的受害者。另一个小组主动用微信向潜在目标发出加好友的请求和消息。目标接受了添加请求后，工人们就按照一个事先写好的剧本操作，据尼奥·陆的描述，骗术过程是这样的：“杀猪”之前

开对话喜哥的团伙之所以以已婚女性为目标，是因为她们出于对名誉的担心，会竭尽全力避免向家人求助或报警，尼奥·陆说。骗钱的速度快到令尼奥·陆惊讶。据他保留下来的记录，在去年7月至11月的五个月里，该团伙从214名受害者那里弄到了相当于440多万美元的钱。尼奥·陆保留下来的文档中还包括一些受害者的联系电话。时报给十几名被该团伙诈骗的女性打了电话。一名要求不具名的女性说，她去年11月被骗走了10.8万元。另一名只说自己姓易（音）的女性说，她去年8月被骗走了25.2万元，其中包括她借来的钱，她现在仍在努力还钱。拥有微信的互联网巨头腾讯在一份声明中表示，公司禁止在该平台上从事犯罪行为，并致力于打击诈骗。腾讯还敦促用户提高警惕。惩罚和监禁为团伙工作了近六个月后，尼奥·陆赢得了绑架者的信任，他们允许他每天用几分钟的私人手机。他与家人和朋友们取得联系，告诉他们自己被绑架了。他拍摄了园区的照片，还在团伙的主要办公室里面拍摄了短视频，同时想方设法不引起注意。他绘制了团伙的组织结构图，还编制了一个行业术语表。他把所有这些文件上传到一个加密的电子邮件帐号，并将其从他工作用的设备上删除。然后，他将这些材料、他保留下来的去年7月到11月的财务记录，以及一份包括诈骗受害者的真实姓名、财务往来记录和电话号码的清单发给了时报。今年1月3日，尼奥·陆哀求喜哥信守承诺，放掉他。他非但没有获得自由，反而被带进一间专门用来惩罚不听话的工人的宿舍。尼奥·陆被铐在一个双层床上，只有吃饭和上厕所时才能下来。一名看守对他全程监控。尼奥·陆的电子设备被没收。他告诉绑架他的人，他已向媒体和朋友求救。“我是想让他们明白，我已经把自己和他们都逼入绝境，”他回忆道。“他们不能再信任我，或将我转卖给另一个团伙。我是一颗定时炸弹。”折磨是那个时候开始的。一名负责园区后勤工作的男子扇他的嘴巴，并对他拳打脚踢，他只知道此人叫阿宏。阿宏用一根空心PVC管打他，用电棍电击他。尼奥·陆疼痛难忍。阿宏告诉他，他会继续受惩罚，直到他不再提出要走。在殴打间隙，团伙的头头们轮流出面劝说尼奥·陆放弃离开的念头。他们许诺让他领导一个专门针对说英语的受害者的新部门，在这个职位上他能赚更多的钱。尼奥·陆拒绝了，并说他的家人会支付赎金。一天，阿宏进到屋里，用一条灰色围巾把脸遮起来。他在屋子里架起了摄像机，一群人聚集在旁边观看。按下“录制”键后，他拿起了电棍。他是在录制勒索视频。尼奥·陆在中国的父母收到的勒索视频的截图。1月14日，在距离尼奥·陆3000多公里远的中国台州，他父母的手机亮了起来。犯罪团伙给他们发来了两段视频。视频中可以看到，尼奥·陆盘腿坐在两个双层床之间的地上，双手被反铐在背后。一名站在旁边的男子对他挥舞着电棍，电棍触击到他身子时的强烈电流引发出刺耳的噼啪声，还伴有蓝色的火花。持电棍者先是触击尼奥·陆的右膝，然后是左膝、腹部和背部。在一段视频中，尼奥·陆疼得在地上打滚，痛苦地嚎叫着。对他的父母来说，这些视频难以承受。“我老公不让我看，他看了，”尼奥·陆的母亲彭女士说，她要求记者不使用她的全名。“我是受不了。”救援该团伙索要的赎金是50万元人民币。尼奥·陆的父母经营的是横幅和LED标牌的小生意，对他们来说，那是一笔不小的钱。彭女士回短信给喜哥，提出需要更多的时间和信息。他们应该怎样支付赎金？把钱转给谁？她补充问道：“让我们人再看一眼……确认一下。”尼奥·陆的父母报了警，并向中国大使馆和商业协会寻求帮助。他们还祈求了更高一层的力量：每天清晨，彭女士和丈夫都会去海边为儿子的平安归来祈祷。后来，他们家所在的浙江省的警方给他们介绍了一名他们说能提供帮助的男子。这个绰号叫“Dragon”的人说，他已成功地将200多名中国公民从东南亚诈骗团伙手中救了出来。他还用博客记录了这些经历。Dragon打电话给尼奥·陆的父母，向他们讲述了接下来可能发生的令人恐惧的细节。他说，绑架者会继续给他们发恐怖的图片和视频。但如果他们支付赎金的话，勒索会没完没了地继续下去。他说，他们该做的是拖延，并表现出愿意配合。他会另找办法。1月21日，也就是收到勒索视频一周后，Dragon告诉尼奥·陆的父母，他有一位有权有势的朋友，是一名与当地武装民兵有联系的中国商人，此人已在当天早些时候去了东美园区，证实了尼奥·陆确在那里。Dragon说，这名朋友两天内就能把尼奥·陆救出来。彭女士给了时报Dragon的联系方式，后者证实了事情的时间线，并笼统地描述了救人过程。Dragon要求匿名，并拒绝提供具体细节，因为担心将事情公开会危及未来的救援。Dragon说，那名人脉广泛的中国商人已在1月23日再次前往东美，这次是在一名将军和缅甸边防部队数十名携带武器的士兵陪同下（边防部队是一个曾支持统治缅甸的军政府的当地武装组织）。这名商人指名说要尼奥·陆。专家们说，当地的民兵组织通常与这些园区的业主们保持关系，但在需要的时候也对在园区内活动的犯罪团伙进行控制。Dragon说，喜哥发的尼奥·陆受折磨的视频已引起了中国当局的注意，这就越界了。Dragon说，这让他的生意伙伴（也就是那名商人）能让将军出面处理尼奥·陆的事情。时报无法独立核实救援细节。尼奥·陆在那间屋子里总共被关了18天，他对谈判一无所知。一天，他突然被通知换衣服，然后上了一辆高尔夫球车。就这样，尼奥·陆被放出来了。他说，当地民兵对他进行了讯问，拿走了他的手机、笔记本电脑、身份证件和现金。几天后，他回到了中国。他乘坐的航班在2月2日抵达了上海。母亲为他准备了一件厚厚的冬衣，因为她知道从东南亚回来的儿子穿的衣服不御寒。看到儿子从到达区出来后，她如释重负。尼奥·陆拥抱了父母，他们都禁不住流下了眼泪。虽然家人避免了向犯罪团伙支付赎金，但彭女士说，她已把25万元转给了Dragon。Dragon说这笔钱是给他的朋友和那名将军的，以感谢他们的帮助。回国的第二天，尼奥·陆找到中国警方，把他收集的所有材料交给了他们，并详细描述了他所知道的诈骗过程。时报看到的一份警方通报称，当局已帮助将尼奥·陆从缅甸的一个电信诈骗园区救出来，通报还说尼奥·陆“之前并未从事网络赌博，电信诈骗等活动”。近几个月来，中国当局已与东南亚国家的官员采取联合行动，逮捕了数千名被指控参与电信诈骗犯罪团伙的中国人，并已将他们遣返回国，但专家们认为，许多犯罪团伙只是将业务转移到了其他地方。尼奥·陆记得，一名绑架者告诉他出去后要保持缄默。但尼奥·陆另有打算。他已接受了中国媒体的采访，为一个电影项目提供了咨询，并打算写一本回忆录。“我想让全世界知道，这些中国人犯罪团伙正在进行的是一种现代奴隶制，”他说。

Blue for The New York Times影响着世界半数人口的一个人生阶段的教育在医学院仍然被严重忽视。2017年对全国住院医生进行的一项调查发现，20%的人没有上过任何关于更年期主题的课程，三分之一的受访者表示，他们不会对有症状的女性采用激素疗法，即使患者没有明确会增加这样做的风险的身体状况。“几年前，当我女儿正在准备医护资格考试时，我问了她这个问题，无论出题的人是谁，答案都不会是‘给她们激素’，”桑托罗说。近年来，事情获得了一些进展：宾夕法尼亚大学建立了更年期诊所，约翰·霍普金斯大学现在为学生提供课堂教学和实践机会。但在妇科领域仍然会有许多人从医学院毕业时没有这方面的准备，无法向需要帮助的更年期女性给出建议，这一点未来几十年恐怕都不会改变。我去看妇科医生时 完全不知道这些。我只知道朋友们告诉我的那些，以及激素疗法是一种选择。那是我第二次与那位妇科医生会面，她给我的印象是时髦、专业、有些匆忙——这并不令人意外，因为她隶属于一家大型医疗集团，那种让人觉得宁愿死于任何让你不舒服的东西、也不愿拨打他们的自动应答电话的公司。我们的会面节奏很快，没有频繁的眼神交流，这让我在提出自己的担忧前犹豫不决：我觉得自己在发牢骚，甚至是不合时宜。但我还是坚持了下来。我告诉她，我有潮热，虽然不是经常性的，但已经足够让我感到困扰。而在所有问题中记忆问题是最困扰我的，所以我接着提出了这个问题。“但这也可能只是正常的衰老，”她说。她停顿了一下，略带怀疑地看了我一眼。“我们只针对明显的症状开激素处方。”她告诉我。我感到被拒绝了，谈话看起来如此之快就结束了也令我很吃惊。我开始怀疑自己。我的症状算“明显”吗？根据什么来定义呢？女性本应在更年期感觉到对自己的身体有了最大的控制权，我们至少终于可以摆脱被迫意外怀孕的风险了。然而，对许多女性来说，更年期成为了一场新的控制我们身体的斗争，这不是因为立法或宗教，而是因为我们和医生都缺乏相关知识。更年期不仅是人生的一个新阶段，也是一种困惑的状态。在我们有权感到自己经验丰富的时候，女性却被迫成为了一个新手，更糟的是还要承担起一个医学侦探的角色，负责解决我们自己的问题。即使是我认识的最为聪慧的那些女性——当你急需又快又好地完成某件事情时你会打电话给她们的那种人——也说自己对人生的这一阶段感到“困惑”。最近的一项全国性调查发现，35%的更年期女性表示她们出现过四种或四种以上的症状，但只有44%的人表示她们曾与医生讨论过自己的症状。更年期女性在主动与医生谈及这些时往往会感到尴尬，她们甚至可能不认为自己的症状是更年期症状。“关于更年期的公关宣传是全宇宙历史上最糟糕的，因为它不仅仅是潮热和盗汗，”乔治敦大学性健康专家兼泌尿科临床助理教授蕾切尔·鲁宾说，“一位56岁的女性来找我，说‘哦，是的，我没有潮热和盗汗，但我有抑郁症和骨质疏松症、性欲低下而且在性生活中感到疼痛。这样的情况发生过多少次了？这些都可能是更年期症状。”鲁宾说，在一个理想的世界里，更多的妇科医生、内科医生和泌尿科医生会与他们的中年病人一起拿着荷尔蒙症状列表逐项讨论，而不是等着看这些女性是否有知识和能力自己提出这些症状。WHI试验评估了最严重的、威胁生命的结果：乳腺癌、心脏病、中风和血栓等。但是，对于那些持续脱发、关节疼痛、突然发现自己的体味发生了变化（而且不是向好的方面变化）、抑郁或感到疲惫的女性来说，服用激素的净益处和日常生活质量的提高可能值得她们面对激素治疗带来的任何风险，即使她们已经过了60岁。即使对于像我这样症状不明显但风险较低的女性来说，服用激素也是有意义的。“我并不是说每个女性都需要激素，”鲁宾说，“但我坚信这是你自己的身体，你自己的选择。”关于更年期的讨论缺乏很多东西，其中之一是在帮助我们做选择时所使用的语言。有些女性在成为母亲的过程中事事顺心，但也有一些女性分娩后忍受着极度的焦虑和抑郁，这就是产后抑郁症。有些女性每个月都会来月经，不会出现大的波动；有些女性则会出现情绪变化，扰乱日常工作，患上我们所说的经前综合征(PMS)，严重的还会患上经前焦虑症。有相当一部分女性在进入更年期时没有任何症状。一些人则遭受了近乎全身性的崩溃，出现脑雾、反复潮热和疲惫。还有一些人能够感受到自己身上发生的变化，并且清楚地知道自己不喜欢这样，但她们并非失去了行为能力。更年期这个宽泛的术语过于庞大，要素过于繁多，造成了一种混乱，让谈论它变得尤其困难。与更年期最密切相关的症状莫过于潮热，这种现象常常被简化为一种喜剧套路——中年妇女疯狂地对着脸扇扇子，往衣服里塞冰块。70%到80%的女性都会有潮热现象，但研究人员几乎和经历潮热的女性一样对它知之甚少。这反映出我们对更年期生物学还有多少需要了解的地方。科学家们现在正试图弄清，潮热仅仅是一种症状还是会引发身体的其他变化。奇怪的是，女性体内灼热的感觉并没有反映在核心体温的明显升高上。潮热源于下丘脑，这是大脑中一个富含雌激素受体的区域，在生殖周期中起着至关重要的作用，同时也起着恒温器的作用。由于缺乏雌激素，下丘脑的恒温器现在变得不正常，它更容易将核心体温的微小升高误认为是太热了，从而引发大量出汗和血管广泛扩张，试图给身体降温。这也会使皮肤温度升高。有些女性一天会出现一次这种情况，有些则会出现10次或更多次，每次持续几秒钟到五分钟不等。女性经历这些症状的时间为七到10年。除了对女性生活质量的影响之外，这些症状是否也预示着危害？2016年，瑟斯顿在学术期刊《中风》(Stroke)上发表的一项研究表明，潮热次数较多（每天至少四次）的女性往往有更多心血管疾病的迹象。这种联系甚至强于心血管风险与肥胖或高血压之间的联系。“我们不知道这是否是因果关系，”瑟斯顿告诫说，“也不知道是向哪个方向发展。我们需要更多的研究。”瑟斯顿告诉我，甚至可能有些女性会因为潮热而加快身体的衰老，有些则不会。她说，至少，关于严重和频繁潮热的报告应该提醒医生更密切地关注女性的心脏健康。瑟斯顿试图确定潮热对血管健康的影响，伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的精神病学教授宝琳·马基则正在建立潮热与更年期轻微认知变化之间的联系。马基已经发现，女性潮热的次数与记忆力之间存在明显的相关性。马基和瑟斯顿想知道，他们是否能在大脑中检测到这种关联的某种物理表现。他们着手进行的研究发现，女性在睡眠中潮热的次数与脑部微小血管受损的迹象之间存在很强的相关性。在匹兹堡的一个实验室里，瑟斯顿向我展示了一幅大脑图像，图像上的微小病变表现为白点，像幽灵一样消失在扫描仪上。她说，这些病变的数量和位置在潮热次数多的女性中都有所不同。但究竟是潮热导致了损害，还是脑血管的变化导致了潮热，她也无法确定。约20%的女性在围绝经期和更年期的最初几年会出现认知能力下降，主要是在语言学习、获取和总结新信息方面。但这种下降的机制是多种多样的。随着雌激素水平下降，同语言学习相关的大脑区域被认为会招募其他区域来支持其运作。在这段过渡时期，大脑正在形成新的通路，这或许可以解释一些女性所经历的认知能力下降。对她们中的大多数人来说，这只是短暂的神经混乱。威尔康奈尔医学院神经学副教授兼女性大脑研究中心主任丽莎·莫斯科尼表示，大多数女性的灰质（处理信息的细胞）体积在稳定之前似乎也会缩小。她把大脑在这些过渡时期经历的过程比作一种“重塑”。但是，瑟斯顿和马基检测到的微小脑损伤并没有消除，它们依然存在，在多年时间里逐渐增加了认知能力下降和失智症的风险。过去15年中，有四项随机对照试验发现，服用雌激素对认知能力没有影响。但马基指出，这四项研究并没有专门针对中度到重度潮热的女性。她认为这可能是关键因素：马基推断，如果使用雌激素治疗潮热，研究人员可能会发现认知健康有所改善。在马基进行的一项小型试验中，约有36名女性都有中度至重度潮热，其中一半人接受了一种能减轻潮热的麻醉治疗，另一半人则接受了安慰剂治疗。她测量了两组人在治疗前和治疗后三个月的认知功能，发现随着潮热的改善，记忆力也得到了提高。她说，这项试验的规模很小，但它“带来了假设”。即使考虑到女性寿命更长的因素，阿尔茨海默病在女性中的发病率也高于男性，这是大脑健康方面的众多差异之一，研究人员因此开始思考雌激素（可能还有激素疗法）在认知能力衰退过程中可能扮演的角色。但迄今为止，有关荷尔蒙疗法和阿尔茨海默病的研究尚无定论。关于荷尔蒙和大脑的现有研究都集中在更年期女性身上，这意味着目前还无法知道围绝经期女性在认知功能暂时下降期间是否可以从服用雌激素和孕激素中获益。“还没有一项针对围绝经期女性的激素疗法随机试验，”马基说，“这太糟糕了，对吧？”瑟斯顿说，同样还不清楚的是，更年期的各种认知变化现象——暂时性的倒退、高遗传风险女性的阿尔茨海默氏症发展，以及小血管脑部疾病标志物的出现——是如何相互作用或相互反映的。瑟斯顿说：“我们还没有对女性进行足够长时间的跟踪研究，因此还无从得知。”她认为，更年期保健的起点和终点都需要一句关键的名言：“我们需要更多的研究”。Marta Blue for The New York Times在信息存在空白的情况下，一个庞大的更年期保健产业应运而生，产品琳琅满目，但福比恩认为这些产品大多只是 “洗剂和药液”。但市场上也出现了一批新的公司，提供经FDA批准的治疗，包括激素疗法。Midi Health提供虚拟的面对面服务，由经过更年期治疗培训的医生和执业护士开具激素处方，一些保险机构也会承保这些药物；Evernow和Alloy等网站直接向患者出售药物。（马基是Midi和Alloy的医学顾问委员会成员）。在Alloy网站上，女性回答一系列有关其症状、家庭和病史的问题，公司的算法就会推荐（或不推荐）处方。开处方的医生会审查病例，并通过短信或电话回答问题，如果女性决定完成订单，只要处方有效，她就可以通过短信与开处方的医生联系。Alloy举办在线支持小组活动，明显来自不同社会经济背景的女性经常在小组中倾诉——她们如何艰难寻找解脱的方法，她们仍在忍受多么大的痛苦，在承受痛苦而寻求帮助时，他人的缺乏同情和关心如何让她们依然饱受创伤。7月，一位中年女性在电话中描述了严重的阴道干涩症状。“走路或者想锻炼的时候，我都会觉得非常痛苦，”她说。“光是动一动都很疼”。她试图购买雌二醇阴道乳膏，这是一种风险极低的药物，用来治疗泌尿生殖系统综合征；她说，她所在的小镇上，这种药品非常短缺。在偶然发现Alloy之前，她一直依靠抗菌药膏来缓解疼痛。这个空间显然是一个没有人来品头评足的地方，女人们可以在这里谈论她们对激素治疗风险收益的个人感受。在一次小组讨论中，一名女性说，她一直在接受激素治疗，这在围绝经期“改变了我的生活”，但她和她的姐妹们同期的乳房X光检查结果让她们感到担忧。她的一位姐妹被诊断为乳腺癌，并切除了淋巴结；而她被诊断为非典型增生，虽然不是癌症，但被认为是一种使女性处于高风险之中的前兆。NAMS指南并没有表示激素疗法是乳腺癌高危女性的禁忌，而是让女人和她们的医生来决定是否接受这种疗法。这名女性说：“我新的妇科医生和癌症医生都不让我使用激素。”她转而从Alloy购买了激素。所以，我现在有点偷偷摸摸的。”讨论会上没有人质疑这名女性违背两位医生建议的决定。我向福比恩提到了这个例子。她说：“在我看来，她觉得医生没有聆听她的想法，所以只好去别的地方求助。”福比恩告诉我，在某些情况下，充分了解风险但出现可怕症状的高风险女性可能会合理地做出选择激素疗法的决定。但她说，做这些决定需要与医护人员进行细致入微、深思熟虑的沟通，她不知道Alloy和其他在线服务提供商的机制是否能够做到。Alloy创始人之一安妮·福伦韦德说，支持小组中的一名病人在寻求处方时没有透露她的全部病史。在这一情况曝光后，Alloy的一名医生联系了她，就激素疗法的风险和益处进行了更加全面的后续咨询。在权衡我自己的选择时，我有时会直接向我采访过的医生寻求建议。我了解到，对于仍有怀孕风险的围绝经期妇女来说，低剂量避孕药物可以“平衡局面”，抑制生殖系统的关键部分，同时提供更稳定剂量的激素。另一种选择是使用宫内节育器(IUD)进行节育，同时使用低剂量雌激素贴片，这种贴片的药效甚至低于低剂量避孕药，因此被认为更安全。“装备太多了，”当性健康专家雷切尔·鲁宾建议我这么做的时候，我对她说。“所以我不滑雪。”然而我经常想起桑托罗说她给病人的忠告（尤其是60岁以下、身体健康的病人）：身体出现症状时，如果没有体验过治疗见效后的益处，你怎么能权衡这种疗法的风险和收益呢？11月，我开始服用低剂量避孕药。我和我身边的人都确信，我大脑的问题减少了。我没有潮热。最让我惊讶的是（也许这也是认知能力提高的主要原因）：我的睡眠改善了。鉴于我们讨论的时间太短，我甚至没有向我的妇科医生提到过我睡眠质量差的问题，但我也曾以为这是压力、年龄和一个体贴但打鼾的丈夫造成的。直到服用激素之后，我才意识到，我以前经常凌晨两点醒来，也很可能是围绝经期的症状。吃避孕药是个很简单的尝试，但它比宫内节育器和避孕贴有更高的潜在血栓风险；现在我确信使用宫内节育器是值得的，所以我决心一旦能够预约到时间，就立即改用这个方法。有多少女性和我曾经差不多一样，对更年期症状感到不确定或把它们轻描淡写，为抱怨自己不确定是否“严重”的不适而道歉，在与妇科医生、内科医生或家庭保健医生见面时默默地让话题换到下一个？然而……随着我的大脑运转得更加顺畅，我在思考、在担心、在等待更多高质量的研究。也许在下一个十年，当我的个人风险开始急剧升高，我们会懂得更多东西；我所能希望的是，它能证实目前的研究趋势，能让人放心。科学在前进。我们对进展翘首以待，盼着它像衰老本身一样必然到来。
178;NYTimes;https://www.nytimes.com;https://cn.nytimes.com/world/20230912/putins-forever-war/;普京的永恒战争;普京的统治就是要重建这个想象中的俄罗斯世界，或者说“俄罗斯米尔”，这是一个围绕着永恒的俄罗斯文化和帝国领域理念而建立的复仇主义神话，乌克兰是其中不可或缺的一部分，然而乌克兰却决定成为一个独立国家，这永远不可原谅。至于未来，普京几乎没有说什么，人们只能猜测。这不难看出：保镖冲进莫斯科的高档餐厅，为这个体制中的某些头目或寡头腾出空间，在这个体制中，必须对总统付出坚定不移的忠诚，才能获得巨大财富。最重要的是，正是出于恐惧，人们压低声音、犹豫不决，不敢说出普京双重思想中的那个险恶之词——“战争“。冷战的苏俄学，变成了另一项同样艰巨的任务：透过克里姆林宫的重重迷雾，弄清普京这位新沙皇在想什么——如今，他已经在自己执政的暮年。高压政策愈发凶狠，普京在乌克兰发起的战争，几乎全然不考虑自己的决策会造成什么后果，这种特质正是约翰·勒卡雷曾说的“精神变态的一项首要条件”。普京主义是矛盾事物的后现代汇集。它是伤春悲秋的苏联怀旧与黑手党式资本主义的结合，是对东征教会的虔诚和无所不在的破碎家庭的结合，是对“单极”的美国世界的猛烈攻击和俄罗斯帝国起死回生后的出击的结合——这一切都是通过对不同意见的无情镇压实现的，必要时会采取暴力手段。在俄罗斯有一个让人越来越解除戒备的现象，它看上去很像美国或欧洲，但其实并非如此。它是“运行在一种不一样的软件上的，”法国大使皮埃尔·列维对我说。对国家秘密的定义在不断改变。我得到的建议是，不要接受除了菜单以外的任何文件，即使是点菜也尽可能扫二维码。在俄罗斯武装部队大教堂的义务兵，向“俄罗斯人民的勇武功绩”致敬。与过去的纽带得到维持，普京在很大程度上已经让斯大林重回人间，尽管没有古拉格。真正的普京信徒在距离莫斯科五个时区的乌兰乌德，一座废弃的苏联时代燃煤发电厂喷出浓烟，笼罩在有波纹铁屋顶的木屋上。重达42顿的世界最大列宁头像，至今在这座人口超40万的城市的中央广场上耸立着。这座静悄悄的城市，如今是俄罗斯布里亚特共和国的首府，冷战时期，这里是固定翼飞机和直升机的生产中心，外国人不得进入，现在它再次卷入一场与西方的战争，而列宁的苏维埃联盟的解体，正是这场战争的根源所在。59岁的经济学家亚历山大·瓦西里耶夫即将第二次前往遥远的前线，他和国防部签了那种价值2500美元的合同。去年十二月，他的挚友维克多·普利卢科夫在索莱达尔附近被乌军火炮击中丧生。几天后，瓦西里耶夫被一枚榴弹炸上了天。“我不太擅长飞翔，”他说。他带着受了重伤的肩膀回到西伯利亚，如今基本已经痊愈。“钱当然是好东西，但那不是我重返的主要原因，”瓦西里耶夫说，他身形健硕，经常在他那间苏联时代的公寓里举铁。“参战是对祖国应尽的义务，”他说。“我们的祖父1945年一直杀到柏林，就为了确保我们不用跟一个敌国作邻居。我们不会让美国给我们安插这么一个邻居。”许多人对普京深信不疑，59岁的亚历山大·瓦西里耶夫就是这样，他将再次上前线。“我是出于对祖国的责任而战，”他说。他的厨房墙上有一个钟在说这番话的同时，，钟面上的普京和他的跟班——有时当他的替身——迪米特里·A·梅德韦杰夫直溜溜盯着他看。“这个钟是我妈妈十年前给我的，因为她觉得我整天骂他们！”他说。“你知道的，我们俄罗斯人常有的抱怨，税收和腐败。我们骂沙皇、斯大林和他的古拉格集中营、叶利钦——然后我们接受现实。”有的人则以更热忱的方式支持战争。44岁的尼古拉·沃罗德尼科夫邀请我去他的车库，他在那里修理车辆，准备送到前线去。他位于西伯利亚的车库已将大约100辆SUV和卡车运往乌克兰。他本人曾在乌克兰的马里乌波尔作战，一座被俄军夷为平地的城市。2022年4月，沃罗德尼科夫在冲进那里的主要行政大楼时胸部中了两颗子弹。在接受紧急护理后，他回到乌兰乌德修养了好几个月。和普京一样，他认为10世纪的基辅罗斯——其领土与今天的乌克兰部分重叠——是现代俄罗斯的诞生地，并且该地区一直是大俄罗斯不可分割的边疆。他说，俄罗斯和乌克兰是“一个整体”。“身上长了个肿瘤——长在乌克兰，我们必须治，”他告诉我。“带来肿瘤的是美国人，他们去了他们没必要去的地方。我们的任务明确且即将达成，正义将得到伸张，法西斯主义将被击败。”尼古拉·沃罗德尼科夫（左）位于西伯利亚的车库已将大约100辆SUV和卡车运往乌克兰。普京“是上帝派到俄罗斯的，”他说。我问他怎么看普京。“他是上帝派到俄罗斯的，”他说。神奇的解决方案在恐怖时期，广大民众要么热情高涨，要么顺从，要么精于算计，要么畏首畏尾。相比之下，一些勇敢的人会转向内心的指南针。39岁的叶夫根尼·弗拉索夫的麻烦始于去年底，当时他开始在Vkontakte（简称VK）上发表批评评论，VK相当于俄罗斯的Facebook。弗拉索夫是乌兰乌德的一名电气工程师，个头高瘦，有一种坦率和无畏，他发了一张来自反对派网站的图片，说明了战争造成的伤亡。图片显示，战争中每死亡一个莫斯科人，意味着达吉斯坦共和国死亡87.5人；他居住的布里亚特共和国死亡275人；以及图瓦死亡350人，图瓦是一个亚洲少数民族的家园，也是俄罗斯最贫困的地区。所有征兵广告牌上的图像几乎都是俄罗斯白人，与之相反的是，在前线阵亡的人中有很大一部分来自俄罗斯少数民族，Mediazona等独立新闻媒体证实了这一情况。这就是弗拉索夫要表达的。他的朋友告诉他停止发帖。他不理会。他认为自己是一个无名小卒，没有人会对他的反战视频感兴趣。弗拉索夫的朋友们大多钦佩普京，他们问他上次看电视是什么时候。他回答说：“我十年前就不再看了。都是垃圾。这就是为什么我有不同的观点。”什么样的观点？“我一直很愤怒，”他说。“我就是不明白为什么我们去年必须攻击乌克兰。没有什么正常的理由。”弗拉索夫认为，总统已经迷失了方向。2014年吞并克里米亚的过程非常顺利，普京认为消灭乌克兰也很容易。“唯一的问题是，”弗拉索夫说，“乌克兰一直在做准备，而普京的亲信却一直在偷窃数十亿美元，这就是为什么我们的士兵在四处寻找袜子。”思索片刻后，弗拉索夫说：“普京是个小偷。乌克兰战争向俄罗斯人展示了为建造他的宫殿而损失了多少资金。”去年12月，一名警察打电话命令弗拉索夫到当地派出所报到。弗拉索夫询问原因。对方没有给出任何理由。不管怎样，他还是去了。他被问那些含有批判战争的社交媒体页面是否是他的。他说是的。警方整理了一份报告，称他已经认罪——但他没有——并且如果他再犯，他将被罚款6万卢布（约合630美元），还会被监禁。弗拉索夫聘请了一位名叫纳德日达·尼佐夫金娜的律师，她是乌兰乌德政治反对派的活跃人士。“我为言论自由而战，但我也与正在发生的一切作斗争，”她告诉我。“根据宪法，我的当事人应该可以自由地发布他想要发布的内容。”在过去的六个月里，弗拉索夫已三次出庭。他的罚款最终减半，然后在4月被取消，但他尚未收到任何表明已结案的官方信息。弗拉索夫想要离开俄罗斯，他的孩子分别是10岁、9岁、4岁和2岁。他看不到一家人在乌兰乌德的未来。他的梦想是去加利福尼亚州当电工；他认为妻子可以在美甲沙龙找到一份工作。“普京在位太久了，孩子们都不会问下一个总统会是谁，他们问下一个普京是谁，”他说。“这可不是什么好事。”弗拉索夫回忆起2021年参加声援阿里克谢·A·纳瓦尔尼的示威活动，也就是那位被关押的反对派领袖，这周他又被判了19年徒刑，监狱的条件十分恶劣。“有很多人在抗议，”他说。“普京的支持率在下降。”两年下来，他的一些曾经参加抗议的朋友已经成了普京的支持者，他把这种态度的转变归咎于“战争带来的神奇解决方案”。我们约定第二天在南方公墓见面，那里距离乌兰乌德40分钟车程，坐落在一片松树林中。市中心的墓地已经没有更多空间了。我们漫步穿过广阔的墓地，经过骨瘦如柴的流浪狗和野餐桌，还有阳光下闪闪发光的大束彩色塑料花，周围是新挖的士兵坟墓。墓地的一整块都留给乌兰乌德的战死者。一对老夫妇正在准备一个坟墓，他们铲土，夯土。在他们准备安放的墓碑旁边，地上放着一个水平仪。。我问他们埋葬的是谁。“我们的孙子。”他多大了?“19”。出了什么事？“乌克兰的事。”墓碑上写着：安德烈·马利克，生于2003年5月4日，卒于2022年10月31日。当我读着这段铭文时，他们的女儿走过来，威胁说，如果谈话继续下去，她要就打电话给无处不在的联邦安全局。重新打一场旧仗5月30日，布里亚特共和国成立100周年庆典在华丽的乌兰乌德歌剧院举行，天花板上悬挂着苏联飞机的壁画，机身上有红星和印着列宁肖像的苏联国旗。该国首脑阿列克谢·齐杰诺夫是普京领导的统一俄罗斯党成员，他发表了半个小时的讲话，赞扬在“二战”中牺牲的3.9万名布里亚特人。然后，他表彰了八名在当前战争中被授予“俄罗斯英雄”称号的当地士兵。他将勋章别在其中三位英雄的衣襟上，又别在几位1941–1945年伟大卫国战争老兵的衣襟上，全场起立鼓掌。这是普京策划的将两场战争牵强融合的完美写照。“今天，新一代再次扮演了纳粹主义征服者的角色，”齐杰诺夫宣称。“我们的军队会赢的。在历史的各个阶段，总有人希望我们遭殃。但我们克服了所有障碍。”布里亚特共和国成立一百周年庆典上，过去和现在的英雄们都别上了勋章。“新一代的人再次扮演了纳粹主义征服者的角色，”普京所在政党的布里亚特州长说，他指出两场冲突之间的历史联系。随后是一场具有苏联风格的戏剧表演，其中包括一个全男性舞蹈团，他们随着一首歌颂煤炭生产的赞美诗旋转舞动，向下挥动手臂，唱着：“是的！是的！煤炭生产是我们的责任，整个俄罗斯支持我们！”在外面，气氛没有那么欢欣鼓舞。对许多人来说，平均每月几百美元的工资意味着艰苦的生活。伊琳娜·康措娃的两个女儿七岁和九岁，她们是从电视上得知了33岁的父亲马克西姆·康措夫去年在乌克兰去世的消息。她感觉自己无法对她们说出口。她的大女儿玛格丽塔早早从学校回来，看到电视上宣布她的父亲获得了俄罗斯金星英雄奖。我们开车去了那对夫妇第一次见面的高中。学校正面新贴了一块牌匾，是为了纪念康佐夫的英勇行为，他在遥远的土地上为一位年迈领导人的执念而牺牲。康索娃是林业专家，她站在牌匾旁边。“你无法击垮俄罗斯人民，”她说。“尤其是俄罗斯女性。”伊琳娜·孔索娃在纪念其前夫马克西姆·孔索夫的牌匾旁。看着她，我满脑子想的都是这一切带来的浪费，没有父亲的孩子，纠缠不清的历史留下的有毒遗产，以及所有那些为纪念战争的血腥牺牲而颁发的奖章。“沉默之塔”她的书桌上放着打字机，还有她的眼镜、笔记和一本书，书的标题总结了普京时代的有罪不罚现象：《调查无定论的历史》(History of an Inconclusive Investigation)。你要走过自2000年以来被杀害的另外六名《新报》记者的照片。他们以不同的方式遵循了伟大的战时摄影师罗伯特·卡帕的格言，穆拉托夫在诺贝尔奖获奖感言中引用了这句话：“如果你的照片不够好，说明你离得不够近。”61岁的穆拉托夫坐在一间挂着米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫照片的办公室里，这位领导人现在受到许多俄罗斯人的唾弃，他拒绝共产主义，支持言论自由、企业自由和开放边界。“他对待活物非常小心，”穆拉托夫告诉我。“他是一个农民。他珍视生命。现在，在我们国家，死亡比生命更重要。”“我们是一个窒息的社会，”被关闭的独立报纸《新报》的编辑德米特里·A·穆拉托夫说。过去17个月就像送葬队伍的行进。政府开战没多久就关闭了《新报》以及其它一些最独立的媒体。报社的一个分支《欧洲新报》目前在拉脱维亚的里加出版。穆拉托夫还是待在俄罗斯，他称这是个“视真相为犯罪”的国家。宣讲真相的人——纳瓦尔尼、大声批评克里姆林宫的弗拉基米尔·卡拉-穆尔扎、批评战争的伊利亚·雅辛、戏剧导演叶夫根尼亚·贝尔科维奇和无数作家与诗人——都已经身陷囫囵。“我们是个窒息的社会，”穆拉托夫说。“俄罗斯已经成为一座无声的巨塔。”他说，没人知道国家是怎么想的。唯一知道的是老一辈像信教一样相信普京。至于年轻人，自开战以来已经有多达一百万最优秀、最明智的年轻人离开俄罗斯。穆拉托夫说，这些人不想杀人和被杀。他们不认为荣誉可以通过流血来获得。他们倒是相信，荣耀在艺术和知识中。他认为，要取代这群人，需要经历一个或几个世代的时间。在俄罗斯还有一些愤怒的年轻人。在临近俄乌边境的别尔哥罗德地区，乌克兰的越境攻击迫使数万俄罗斯人逃离家园，我在这里遇见了19岁的伊利亚·科斯秋科夫。牧师在为应征入伍的士兵祈福。自战争开始以来，多达100万不想杀人或被杀的俄罗斯年轻人逃离了家园。靠近俄罗斯西部边境的别尔哥罗德地区的舍贝基诺遭到乌克兰人的反击。他在去年因为反战而被大学开除，不过他已经学到了足够多的知识，足以从事他称为“律师”的工作，主要是帮助迫切想要避免上前线或离开前线的俄罗斯人。“我们在政府最高层放了个FSB的人，我们让土匪来运作和统治，我们觉得，无论出了什么问题，都可以通过一场选举来修正，”科斯秋科夫说，“但是等人们开始明白过来已经晚了——于是现在就这样了！”在俄罗斯生活表象之下，潜藏着一场剧烈的代际冲突。冲突何时爆发尚不得而知，但看起来总有一天会爆发。在莫斯科，我问穆拉托夫是什么促使普京对乌克兰发起无所顾忌的侵略。“他对西方产生了极度的厌恶，”穆拉托夫说。“这些领导人和政客会到莫斯科来，”上午去波利特科夫斯卡娅坟前祭拜，与公民社会代表大谈人权，然后他们会去见普京，签下石油天然气合约。伊利亚·科斯图科夫因反对战争而被大学开除，现在他帮助绝望的俄罗斯人避开或离开战争前线。“他们卸任后，”他说，“普京会收买他们——前德国总理格哈德·施罗德、前法国总理弗朗索瓦·菲永——他们都欣然接受普京的钱。于是他就得出结论，西方嘴上说的价值观都是垃圾。”在穆拉托夫看来，普京还得出了另一个结论：西方各国抓住后苏联时代俄罗斯的弱点，抹杀红军在1945年一路杀到希特勒的柏林这样的功绩。西方因此侮辱了2700万在战争中丧生的苏联人，这其中就有普京的哥哥。他的父亲当时身受重伤。西方是通过将北约东扩至俄罗斯边境来实现这一目标的，在普京看来，这本身就是背信弃义。“于是普京决定，要获得已经结束的第二次世界大战的胜利，”穆拉托夫说。“他要保护那场战争的胜果。这就是为什么要告诉我们，我们是在和纳粹和法西斯作战。”苏联专制共产主义统治的结束，1989年柏林墙的倒塌，都奇迹般地没有流血，但现在看来，其实并非如此。一种新的国家意识形态在普京看来，战争的性质已经扩大，成为对西方的文明之战。它也许是在乌克兰进行，但莫斯科的敌人远不止于此。用俄罗斯外国情报机构负责人谢尔盖·纳雷什金近日的话说，美国、欧洲和北约现在被一致认定为“彻头彻尾的恶魔崇拜”之源。既然成了意识形态战争，就会愈发难以控制。“目前完全没有和谈的基础，”克里姆林宫发言人迪米特里·S·佩斯科夫对我说。“我们会在可见的未来继续这场行动。”反西方的恶言恶语已经达到光怪陆离的程度。这是一种正在成形的国家意识形态的一部分，为接下来几十年的潜在冲突埋下伏笔。上世纪90年代，对自由主义充满热忱期待的俄罗斯通过了一部宪法，其第13条写道，“任何意识形态不得被确立为国家的或必须服从的意识形态。”三十年后，普京的俄罗斯正加速走向一种秉守保守主义价值观的新官方意识形态。包括司法部长康斯坦丁·丘琴科在内的一些人提出了修宪废除第13条的可能性。这种反西方意识形态是围绕东正教会、祖国、家庭和“精神高于物质”的观念建立起来的，后者在普京于11月发布的关于精神和道德价值的政令中得到体现。政令宣称美国以及“其它不友好的外国政府”是敌人，意图培育“自私、悲观、背德和对爱国主义理想的否定”，并且要“通过推广非传统的性关系来摧毁传统家庭”。如果说在冷战中西方被描绘为冷酷资本主义的恐怖大本营，那么在现在的俄罗斯看来，它是性改变、变装皇后泛滥、野蛮的性辩论和LGBTQ称霸的源头。“面对西方公然利用乌克兰的人肉发起的战争，俄罗斯还要忍耐多久？”背景深厚的俄罗斯外交专家谢尔盖·卡拉加诺夫在接受采访时说。“核战的风险很高，并且越来越高，”他说。“这场战争就是加长版的古巴导弹危机，但这一次面对的是否定母性、父母之道、性别、爱国、信仰、神明等正常价值观的西方领导人。”俄罗斯这种几乎不加掩饰的核威胁是这场对西方的厉声讨伐行动的一部分。从3月底到5月，俄罗斯一直在表示，一个正面冲突的新阶段已经到来。《华尔街日报》记者埃文·格尔什科维奇被以间谍罪名逮捕，这是冷战以来第一次逮捕外国记者，美国政府和他所在的报社都强烈否认这一指控。四个月后，他仍在莫斯科的列福尔托沃监狱忍受煎熬。过去近75年来一直处于俄美合作核心的莫斯科英美学校在5月12日的法庭裁决下彻底关闭，一家地方报纸指责该校传播LGBTQ价值观。在接下来2024年3月的俄罗斯总统大选中，普京无疑会毫无顾忌地利用这种意识形态的讨伐和在乌克兰的战争。他的再度当选几乎是板上钉钉，他将得到一个之后可以继续连任的六年任期。《华尔街日报》记者埃文·格什科维奇在莫斯科一家法院受审，他是冷战以来第一位被捕的西方记者。去年在莫斯科一家同性恋俱乐部举行的万圣节狂欢，尽管有国家宣传，派对仍在继续。“我们的总统选举其实不算民主，只是昂贵的官僚政治，”克里姆林宫发言人佩斯科夫说。“普京先生明年将以超过90%的得票率再次当选。”普京的支持率唯一一次出现下跌是在去年9月，也就是下达局部动员令的时候。“我们看到普京的民调出现30年来最大幅度的隔夜下滑，”俄罗斯唯一大型独立民调机构勒瓦达中心的主任丹尼斯·沃尔科夫在莫斯科对我说。“战争突然出现在了眼前。”据专注于登门调查的勒瓦达的数据，普京的支持率从80%跌倒了50%左右。此后普京的支持率恢复到了80%左右，至于民调在当前环境下能有多可靠就见仁见智了。尽管与大量证据相左，普京仍坚称乌克兰是一个法西斯和纳粹控制的国家，并且西方想把乌克兰变成又一个性别转换道德堕落的大本营，因此他成功地将一场侵略战争变成了卫国战争，本质上是在拯救俄罗斯，让它的实体和道德构造免遭被肢解的命运。去年在莫斯科，一名俄罗斯义务兵正在拥抱他的伴侣。莫斯科，学生们奔向胜利博物馆。“我们看到的不是一个在位数十年的当权势力会使用的那种四平八稳的语言，”卡内基俄罗斯欧亚中心的鲍诺夫说。“这是一个掌握核武的大国，在散发出一种革命者的炽热。”浪漫主义者普京在普京时代末期有一种镜像效应。他对西方和乌克兰的指责——侵略、法西斯主义、核威胁——成了他自己的行动。乌克兰的马里乌波尔在2023年被俄罗斯夷为平地的样子更像1943年被纳粹摧毁的斯大林格勒（今伏尔加格勒）。这位俄罗斯领导人心中的复仇之火在乌克兰战争前夕达到了顶峰。因苏联解体而失去克里米亚成为一个久久不愈的伤口，因为俄罗斯人普遍认为那是国家历史的一个核心组成部分。“普京执着于他所认为的公道，”阿里克谢·A·韦涅季克托夫说，他的电台“莫斯科回声”曾经很受欢迎，但在战争开始后很快遭到取缔。“他在2014年对我说，‘你可能对克里米亚的并入有不满，但那是正当的。’”韦涅季克托夫说他跟普京很熟。他认为所有人，包括他自己，都对这位俄罗斯领导人有误解。“我们看不到那个肩负着复仇历史使命的普京，”他告诉我。“我们以为他是一个腐败的家伙，出身贫困家庭，想要游艇、宫殿、女人和金钱。我们不觉得他是个认为苏联的解体不公平的克格勃官员。我们认为他是个冷血自私的人。事实上，他是个浪漫主义者。”“我们看不到那个肩负着复仇历史使命的普京，”阿列克谢·A·韦涅季克托夫说。民族主义不是法西斯主义，但它是法西斯主义的重要组成部分。承诺以虚幻过去的名义改变现在，打造一个除了荣耀之外，在各方面都很模糊的未来，这就是它的永恒本质。对普京来说，历史是塑造当前事件的工具。他对历史真相完全不感兴趣，”奥列格·奥尔洛夫说。他是一位重要的人权活动人士，担任“纪念”团体的负责人30多年，该组织于2021年被取缔。现年70岁的奥尔洛夫目前正在受审，罪名是“采取公开行动，诋毁对俄罗斯联邦武装部队的使用”。他最多可面临三年的监禁。多年来，普京政权动用了一切手段来重振和重塑历史。“我的历史”主题公园遍布各地，俄罗斯人记住他们的英雄事迹，从13世纪抵抗蒙古人到纳粹入侵。围绕军事主题开展的课程和课外活动也向孩子们灌输了这种思想。5月9日的胜利日庆祝活动中，数以百万计的俄罗斯人举着先烈的画像在全国各地游行，这是俄罗斯卫国战争胜利庆祝的一大特色。然而，今年，在一场低调的仪式上，这些所谓的“不朽军团”活动被取消了。即将离任的德国驻俄罗斯大使格萨·安德烈亚斯·冯·盖尔告诉我：“也许克里姆林宫担心有人会拿着在乌克兰阵亡儿子的照片游行。”俄罗斯的孩子们在围绕军事主题的课程和课外活动中接受灌输思想。今年的胜利日纪念取消了游行中展示烈士画像的活动。去年战争开始时，奥尔洛夫独自站在红场上，举着一条横幅，上面写着“1945：一个战胜法西斯主义的国家。2022：一个法西斯主义获胜的国家。”他告诉我，现在有两个选择。第一种是普京以某种方式被取代，然后开始一段改革时期，就像斯大林之后的赫鲁晓夫时期一样。“第二种选择更为现实，那就是普京政权继续存在，俄罗斯慢慢消亡，”奥尔洛夫说。“它将落后于其他国家，为了使这个政权稳定，镇压会加剧。”三位西方驻俄罗斯大使在莫斯科告诉我，普京几乎肯定拥有足够的国家支持和资金支持，让他至少再打18个月到两年的战争。我问克里姆林宫发言人佩斯科夫，在被吞并的四个省之外，俄罗斯是否希望获得更多的乌克兰领土。“对普京来说，历史是塑造当前事件的工具，”著名人权活动人士奥列格·奥尔洛夫说。“不，”他说。“我们只想控制我们现在写进宪法的所有土地。”俄罗斯陷入漩涡贝加尔湖上的渔业博物馆是一座部分沉入水中的木制建筑，已正式关闭。但客栈老板罗里科娃认为有必要看看它，于是她打开了锁着的门，眼前过去一个世纪以来俄罗斯的缩影。到处散落着放咸鱼的木桶、雪橇、渔网、长凳，以及渔民们乘着木船驶向浩瀚湖面的褪色照片。我想起了法国哲学家罗兰·巴特的一句话：每一张老照片都潜藏着灾难。墙上挂着卫国战争时期的苏联海报：“大鱼上前线！”“赶超计划是所有渔夫的责任！”一桶桶咸鱼被拖过数千公里的俄罗斯大草原，给红军带去滋养，让他们一路打到希特勒统治的柏林，这样的景象似乎概括了苏联人的巨大决心和牺牲，普京坚称，他必须通过更多的战争来纪念这种决心和牺牲。“没有人来问我们：我们是否想要这场战争？”罗里科娃说。在从贝加尔湖返回乌兰乌德的路上，普京为扭转历史而发动的战争的代价是随处可见的。墓园里埋葬着安德烈·梅佐夫，这名2000年出生的海军步兵于2022年3月6日死在了乌克兰。他来自附近的塔洛夫卡镇，曾在国立贝加尔大学读书，并在符拉迪沃斯托克的军队服役。一面海军步兵旗在花束上方飘扬。旗帜上写着海步口号：“所到之处，皆是胜利。”贝加尔湖的渔业博物馆里，褪色的照片和共产主义时代的海报展现了苏联的决心。克里姆林宫附近的一处小型纪念地，反对派领袖鲍里斯·Y·涅姆佐夫于2015年2月27日在这里被枪杀。每次我去墓园探视战争死难者的坟墓，FSB特工都会把车停在50米开外的地方，作为一种委婉的提醒。在莫斯科的最后一天，我去了毗邻克里姆林宫的莫斯科河大桥。一处小型纪念碑标出了反对派杰出领袖鲍里斯·Y·涅姆佐夫在2015年2月27日被枪杀的地点，那是一场明目张胆的政治谋杀。这里总有人在守护，确保纪念花束的新鲜的。这一天，这个任务落到了阿尔卡季·科尼科夫身上，他告诉我：“涅姆佐夫是个诚实的政客，这是很不寻常的。他是个勇敢的人，一个伟大的人。”涅姆佐夫去世前一年，也就是大约十年前俄罗斯在乌克兰顿巴斯地区挑起的战斗开始时，他在自己的Facebook页面上写道：“普京已对乌克兰宣战。这是一场自相残杀的战争。俄罗斯与乌克兰将会因为这个精神不稳定的秘密警察特工的血腥疯狂而付出惨痛代价。两国的年轻男性会死在战场。母亲和姐妹将伤心欲绝。”前段时间，戈尔巴乔夫于2022年8月30日去世之前，《新报》主编穆拉托夫去探望了这位正躺在莫斯科医院里的朋友。曾做出给俄罗斯人自由这个决定的苏联领导人身体状况急剧恶化，已经基本失去意识。去世后，普京没有参加他的葬礼。病房里有一台大电视。电视中一遍遍播放着乌克兰战火纷飞的影像。就在穆拉托夫离开时，他听到戈尔巴乔夫说：“谁会因此而高兴呢？”

According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Tubb is seeking unspecified damages for the unauthorized use of his likeness.In the case, filed Wednesday, Tubbs lawyers said that when the actor played the role of Lt. j.g. Henry Wolfman Ruth in Top Gun, he signed a contract agreeing for his likeness to be used only in the original film.‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ STAR TOM CRUISE ADMITS HE ‘CRIED’ OVER ‘EMOTIONAL’ REUNION WITH CO-STAR VAL KILMERAt the time, movie sequels were virtually nonexistent, so the possibility of expanding the contract to include the use of his image in any future projects wasnt discussed. Despite that fact, the documents state Paramount used the image without seeking his permission and without compensation.The image in question is a photo of the fictional Top Gun Class of 1986, along with U.S. Navy pilots who acted as consultants during filming. It was altered to be used in the movie.‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ PRODUCER JERRY BRUCKHEIMER SAYS ‘NOBODY WORKS HARDER’ THAN TOM CRUISEIn the scene in Top Gun: Maverick, the camera zooms in on the photo to show Tubb with Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards, the other principal members of the cast. According to Tubbs case, his likeness used in that scene is essential in a way that is not incidental.The argument is that Paramount used Tubbs image for commercial gain — the documents note that Top Gun: Maverick was massively successful at the box office — without asking him or offering him compensation. His legal team also argues that his right to privacy was violated.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSThe court documents claim that a third party doesnt own the copyright to the photo used in the film, but that Tubb does own his own image. Still, Paramount used it for purely selfserving commercial purposes and their own business interests. The documents also call the company an unapologetic, chronic, and habitual infringer.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERIts also suggested that Paramount upon information and belief reached out to other actors for permission for similar appearances in the movie.Tubb wants the amount of the damages to be determined in court, but his lawyers state that the amount shouldnt be anything less than $75,000.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPParamount Pictures didnt immediately return Fox News Digitals request for comment. Tubbs lawyers shared that the actor isnt interested in making a public statement, but, He believes the lawsuit and the exhibits speak for him. Hes disappointed that it had to come to this, but trusts that the legal process will produce a just result.

Turley took issue with Judge Arthur Engoron writing that Trump had failed to explain a reason why the judgment should be delayedJUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE DENIES REQUEST TO DELAY $355 MILLION PENALTYJONATHAN TURLEY: [The judges quote] was funny because the explanation is in the figure. He just imposed a $355 million judgment with a law that has never been used in this way. Thats the reason, and its rather obvious. But you also have people like [Attorney General Letitia] James, who have never built a thing other than their political careers, who are now treating these buildings as if theyre theirs. I mean, she said that shes eyeballing a couple of properties that she might want to seize, like this is a fire sale. And the fact is that the judge showed absolutely no sense of equity in any of this. His decision is the decision of a single jurist. And this party wants to have a review, but in order to do that, he has to pony up what is about a half a billion dollars. And that has a gross unfairness to it when you combine the use of the law and the size of his judgment and then this requirement for a deposit. He just simply brushed those aside and his tone almost bordered on the mocking.Trump lawyers had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an orderly post-judgment process.In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights, he wrote.Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trumps assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFox News Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

Willis and Wade maintain that their relationship began in early 2022.JUDGE IN TRUMP GEORGIA CASE IN UNENVIABLE POSITION AS FINAL ARGUMENTS LOOMWillis hired Wade in 2021 to help prosecute her sweeping racketeering case against Trump. Trump co-defendant Michael Roman alleged in court filings last month that Willis should be disqualified from the case, claiming she financially benefited from hiring Wade because of their personal relationship.The date when the two lawyers relationship began is key to the ongoing dispute brought by Trumps attorneys, who argue that their romantic fling compromised the integrity of the case.The defense is trying to prove the existence and extent of any financial benefit to Willis from Wade from their relationship , which is the crux of their argument that Willis should be disqualified.5 EXPLOSIVE MOMENTS FROM FANI WILLIS HEATED TESTIMONY IN TRUMP FULTON COUNTY CASE: IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN...Cellphone data also seems to show that Wade twice traveled to Willis apartment late at night without leaving until the next morning.Wade and Willis have both testified that they did not sleep together at the Hapeville condo.We are required to respond to the filing via the court, and we are preparing a response now, a spokesperson for Willis said of the Friday filing, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Friday affidavit asserts that cellphone data shows Willis and Wade sharing more than 2,000 phone calls and just under 12,000 text messages in the first 11 months of 2021.Judge Scott McAfee will now need to decide whether to admit the Friday affidavit and the cellphone data it contains into evidence.Fox News Digitals Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.

Jason Shoaf told Fox News. I think that is absurd.I want to give Floridians the peace of mind that they can take action to protect their property, their family and their pets, the Republican added.The bill, which would allow Floridians to use lethal force against a bear if they deem it necessary to save their lives, their pets, the lives of other people or to stop a bear from damaging their dwelling, passed the Republican-controlled state Senate on Wednesday 24-12 after the chamber made a clarification to the House version that people who lure bears to hunt them wouldnt be protected. The updated bill is headed back to the House for another vote.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREIf anyone tries to take advantage of this law for that reason, I can assure you theyre going to end up in jail, Shoaf said. We dont have any tolerance for cruelty to animals or for leveraging a self-defense law for hunting purposes here in the state of Florida.SB-632, titled The Taking of Bears, was nicknamed the cocaine bear bill online after Shoaf said Floridians have the right to protect themselves against the bears that are on crack.If you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, he said on the House floor earlier this month.Shoaf clarified that there are no bears ingesting crack cocaine, but said its based on language commonly used in northern Florida where he grew up to describe erratic people or animals.The opponents to this legislation often like to show you the cuddly pictures of the mama bear and the cubs and how calm and friendly they are, Shoaf told Fox News. I wanted to paint a picture of what the bears this legislation is targeting act like.Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat who voted against the bill, said it was meant to make it easier to kill a bear.WISCONSIN ASSEMBLY APPROVES BILL TO HIKE HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE FEES FOR OUT-OF-STATE RESIDENTSCurrent law protects the right to self-protection, she told Fox News. I dont think we need this additional permission structure on top of a gun-happy culture, on top of people thinking that bears are acting erratically or on crack.Critics argue this legislation will result in increased deaths of the once-threatened species. The black bear population has recovered from just several hundred bears in the 1970s to over 4,000 today and is one of Florida’s most successful conservation efforts, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The Bear Hotline received approximately 7,298 calls in total statewide last year, according to FWC, 39% of which were conflict-oriented.There were some complaints that there is an overrun of bears, Polsky said. My response to that was, well, then Fish and Wildlife Commission needs to deal with it, and they need to figure out what were going to do if there are too many bears.Democrats like Polsky who opposed the bill argued the state should do more to focus on other ways to limit human-bear interactions, such as expanding efforts to prevent bears from being attracted to trash in residential areas.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere are better ways to manage bear encounters than to just sit there on your porch with a shotgun and ready to go as soon as you see a bear coming towards you, Polsky said.But Shoaf said the bill’s critics are defending the lives of bears over citizens.They like to say, ‘well, only a few people have been injured and only a few people have been killed.’ I think thats ridiculous, he told Fox News. If anyone has been injured or killed, we need to take it very seriously.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has received widespread scrutiny over her husbands stock purchases, is making bank on another well-timed bet on a familiar corporation.The California Democrats husband, Paul, who owns a San Francisco investment and consulting firm, scooped up between $1 million and $5 million worth of call options in computer chip company Nvidia on Nov. 22. Pelosi, however, held off on reporting the transaction until right before Christmas.Nvidia is not new to the Pelosis. In 2022, Paul grabbed more than $1 million in Nvidia call options — which give investors the right to buy shares of a company at a specific price — just weeks before a congressional vote on providing massive subsidies to the chip manufacturing industry. He sold them after she received criticism over their timing.At the time, Pelosi said that her husband had never made stock purchases based on information she had given him when pressed by Fox News Digital. Her office also distanced her from Pauls financial decisions.NANCY PELOSI SAYS BIDENS AGE IS AN OBJECTIVE FACT, ARGUES ITS ALL RELATIVE: HES YOUNGER THAN I AMThe Speaker does not own any stocks, Pelosis communications director told FOX Business in 2022. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.But long after the storm had calmed, Paul re-invested in the company, with the most recent contract from late last year. The companys stock has since taken off.In early January, Nvidia announced mass production of slower AI chips to be sold to China that complied with U.S. export rules. Weeks later, the U.S. government announced Nvidia would be one of several companies they would partner with on an AI research program, Yahoo Finance reported.Christopher Josephs, co-founder of Autopilot, an app that allows individuals to track and copy a politicians trades, told Fox News Digital he estimates the most recent Pelosi investment to be around $2.5 million and said the shares are up over 50% in just three months, netting them roughly $1.25 million.PELOSI SAYS HER HUSBAND NEVER MADE STOCK PURCHASES BASED ON INFO SHE GAVE HIMPelosis office did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.The former House speaker had previously grabbed attention over her husbands stock timing. Lawmakers spouses can trade in companies or industries their partner may help regulate, but its illegal for family members and members of Congress to profit from inside information.Paul cashed in on Big Tech shortly before the House Judiciary Committee voted to curtail the unregulated power of companies like Google and Amazon in 2021, Fortune reported. The move wasnt considered a threat to the companies, and the tech firms stock prices continued to rise.Paul purchased 4,000 shares of Alphabet, Googles parent company, by exercising call options a week before the vote. The call options allowed him to snag the shares of Alphabet at $1,200 a piece as they closed that day at just over $2,500, according to Fortune. Paul earned $5.3 million on the investment.A few months before the Alphabet purchase, Paul picked up millions of dollars worth of Microsoft stock days before the company announced a lucrative government contract.Paul exercised call options and paid $1.95 million to buy 15,000 shares of Microsoft at a strike price of $130 on March 19, FOX Business reported. That same day, Paul paid $1.4 million for 10,000 shares valued at $140.Microsoft announced a government contract worth nearly $22 billion to supply U.S. Army combat troops with augmented reality headsets just 12 days after Pauls purchase, and the companys share prices increased from about $230 to roughly $255 — or close to 11% — in the weeks following the announcement.PELOSI FACES BACKLASH FOR DEMANDING SWARMING PROTESTERS GO BACK TO CHINA: SLANDEROUS ACCUSATIONSAnd months before the Microsoft purchase, Paul grabbed between $500,000 and $1 million in Tesla investments in December 2020, roughly a month before President Biden announced the federal government would transition its fleet to electric vehicles.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden, who was open about moving toward electric vehicles, in late January 2021 directed federal officials to devise a plan for converting all federal, state, local and tribal fleets, including 225,000 Postal Service vehicles, to clean and zero-emission vehicles, The Washington Post first reported at the time.Bidens infrastructure plan later set aside more than $170 billion for electric vehicle subsidies.

Sara Haines pushed back, denying that human embryos are human life.The topic came up after Alabama’s high court ruled last week that frozen embryos created during fertility treatments should be considered as having the same status as children under state law in wrongful death lawsuits.ALABAMA SUPREME COURT RULES COUPLES CAN SUE FOR WRONGFUL DEATH AFTER EMBRYOS WERE DROPPEDIn the court’s majority ruling , Justice Jay Mitchell wrote, Unborn children are ‘children’ ... without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics.That decision caused many fertility clinics in the state to pause their IVF procedures. The issue has caused widespread cultural debate between those who believe that IVF is ultimately negligent with human life, and those that believe women who want kids and can’t have them naturally should have IVF as an option.The debate spilled over to ABC’s The View Friday, with co-host Sara Haines defending IVF procedures, noting that they are necessary for some women. She then declared that embryos are not a life, and therefore the court’s ruling was wrong.We talked about how egregious a six-week ban was. A fertilized embryos is three to five days old. It is the size of the pen right there, she said, pointing to the tip of her pen.It is not alive outside of a uterus. It has no organs. It is not a life yet. It is not viable ‘til it’s 24 weeks.Hostin jumped in, disputing her, You may not think that. There are at least 50% of Americans –Haines cut Hostin off, proclaiming, No, this is science, Sunny. This is science that’s able to create –Hostin pushed through, saying, 50% of Americans believe that a human embryo is a baby. I am one of those. Getting through some more crosstalk, Hostin added, especially because I went through IVF.Haines shot back, Yeah, but that doesn’t mean facts change. The embryo is an embryo until ten weeks, when it becomes a fetus. A fetus is not viable til 24 weeks. If we’re going to use science, let’s use scientific terms. That’s what that is.ALABAMA FROZEN EMBRYO RULING WILL LIMIT FERTILITY TREATMENT ACCESS, CRITICS SAYUndeterred, Hostin continued: Well, an embryo is the beginning of human life and I know this –This prompted co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin to ask, Well then, why do you support abortion if you believe that?Hostin replied, Oh, I do not support abortion. I’ve said this over and over again. I believe the government shouldn’t be involved in women’s reproductive health.She continued: But I believe that abortion is wrong, and I also believe – not only through my faith but through my experience of having two embryos implanted in my body – and I have a 21-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, that my life would not be the same without them.Hostin concluded her point, adding, And so, if someone destroyed my embryos, I would feel like someone destroyed my [unintelligible] children.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDuring past episodes, Hostin has revealed that her Catholic faith is part of why she personally opposes abortion, though she agrees that women should have the right to choose.In December, she told her colleagues, I have mentioned many times Im pro-life. Ive received a lot of hate mail for it. Thats my personal position, but there has to be a separation between the government and religion.Fox News Digitals Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.

Our goal — that is, Hunter Biden, Devon Archer and me — was to make billions, not millions.Galanis testified that the entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.Because of this access, I agreed to contribute equity ownership to them — Hunter and Devon — for no out-of-pocket cost from them in exchange for their ‘relationship capital,’ he told investigators.Hunter Biden served as vice chairman of the Burnham group and brought strategic relationships to the venture, including from Kazakhstan, Russia and China.BIDEN MET WITH CHAIRMAN OF CHINESE ENERGY FIRM HUNTER DID BUSINESS WITH IN 2017, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIESBurnham was the focal point for integrating a ‘Biden family office’ into a large-scale financial company with international influence, he explained, adding that they acquired some of Hunter Biden’s companies like RSP Investments and Rosemont Seneca Advisors.Galanis understood Joe Biden talked with Hunter about joining the board of CCP-linked joint ventureGalanis testified that, in 2014, he agreed with Hunter and Devon that the Burnham & Company enterprise would be significantly enhanced by forming a partnership with Harvest Fund Management, a $300 billion Chinese financial services company closely connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Harvest, at that time, had already agreed to be a founding partner of BHR Partners, he explained.Fox News Digital has previously reported that Joe Biden met with Jonathan Li, who worked for BHR Partners, in China in 2013.Galanis explained that Henry Zhao, the director of Harvest, was a contact of Hunter Biden’s.HUNTER BIDEN WAS PAID $100K THROUGH JOINT VENTURE WITH CHINESE ENERGY FIRM, EX-ASSOCIATE TESTIFIEDMr. Zhao was interested in this partnership because of the game-changing value-add of the Biden family, including Joe Biden, who was to be a member of the Burnham-Harvest team post-vice presidency, providing political access in the United States and around the world, Galanis testified.Galanis pointed to a draft email dated Aug. 23, 2014, from Hunter Biden, which states: Please also remind Henry [Zhao] of our conversation about a board seat for a certain relation of mine. Devon and I golfed with that relation earlier last week and we discussed this very idea again and as always he remains very very keen on the opportunity.Fox News Digital obtained that draft email.Galanis testified that email was struck from the final version but was drafted with an understanding of what had transpired regarding this effort.Galanis said the email was forwarded to him by Devon Archer with the words: FYI … example of lean in on Henry from Hunter … this is email drafted for him to send to Henry.Galanis testified that the words lean in were used often by Devon and Hunter in our business dealings as a term for access to Vice President Biden’s political influence.As Devon Archer is mentioned as a direct party to the conversation with the vice president on the golf course, it is clear from his email that Devon believed this was an accurate representation of that conversation, Galanis said in his opening statement.I am certain that the phrase ‘a certain relation of mine’ refers to Vice President Biden, and Devon told me about this conversation on the golf course shortly after it happened, Galanis testified. And it was one of many conversations that I understood the vice president had expressing his willingness to join Harvest board after his vice presidency.Joe Biden golfed with his son Hunter and business partner Devon Archer in August 2014HUNTER DEMANDED $10M FROM CHINESE ENERGY FIRM BECAUSE BIDENS ARE THE BEST, HAVE CONNECTIONSThe draft email does not specifically mention Joe Biden’s name or refer to the certain relation as Hunter Biden’s father. However, there is an infamous photo of Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer on the golf course. That photo was taken in mid-August 2014, which would have been a week or so prior to the draft email. News reports indicate the vice president was in the Hamptons at the time.Galanis went on to testify that Zhao regularly sought reassurance about what he termed the ‘intangible goods’ that Vice President Biden serving on the Harvest board would bring to the business plan.He wanted assurances so that he would not ‘lose face,’ Galanis said. In my opinion, there was no other reason for this massive Chinese enterprise to have been interested in doing business with Burnham other than the Biden name.Zhao also worked with Hunter Biden in a separate joint venture with Chinese energy company CEFC.Zhao is the recipient of a now-infamous text message Hunter Biden sent after requesting a $10 million wire for the joint-venture, SinoHawk Holdings.FLASHBACK: HUNTER BIDEN IN 2017 SENT BEST WISHES FROM ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY TO CHINA FIRM CHAIRMAN, REQUESTED $10M WIREI am sitting here with my father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled, Hunter Biden told Henry Zhao, the director of Chinese asset management firm Harvest Fund Management. And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction.Zhao responded, in part, CEFC is willing to cooperate with the family.Ultimately, Joe Biden did not take a seat on the board of the joint venture.Galanis says Hunter Biden put his father, then-VP Joe Biden, on speakerphone with Russian oligarchMeanwhile, Galanis testified that he recalls being with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer at the Peninsula Bar in New York, where Hunter took a call from his father. He told his father things were going well with Henry and Harvest and that he might need a little help getting it across the finish line.Hunter did not put the call on speaker as we were at this bar, but I am certain that Hunter was discussing our business efforts on the Burnham-Harvest partnership and that the vice president was aware of these efforts, Galanis testified, adding that was not the only time I heard Hunter call his father regarding business matters.Archer last year testified before the House Oversight Committee that Hunter put his father, who was vice president at the time, on speakerphone while meeting with business partners at least 20 times, and he said Joe Biden was put on the phone to sell the brand.Galanis testified that call was not the only time he heard Hunter call his father regarding business matters, pointing to a separate call in which Hunter Biden put his father on speaker. Galanis said Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina and her husband, the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, were present for the call, which took place May 4, 2014.Fox News Digital has previously reported that Joe Biden attended dinners in 2014 at Cafe Milano in Georgetown in 2014 and 2015 with Baturina and others.HUNTER BIDEN REQUESTED KEYS FOR NEW OFFICE MATES JOE BIDEN, CHINESE EMISSARY TO CEFC CHAIRMAN, EMAILS SHOWHunter called his father, said hello and ‘hold on, Pops,’ then put the call on speakerphone and said, ‘I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello,’ Galanis recalled. The vice president said hello and some pleasantries of ‘Hope you had safe travels,’ and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, ‘OK then, you be good to my boy.’Galanis said Hunter responded by saying, Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.The vice president said something about ‘being helpful,’ and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later, Galanis testified. I recall being stunned by this call — to actually hear the vice president of the United States speaking on the phone.Galanis testified that it was clear to him that this was a pre-arranged call with his father meant to impress the Russian investors that Hunter had access to his father and all the power and prestige of his position.Days later, on May 9, 2014, Archer sent Galanis an email, obtained by Fox News Digital, which revealed Baturina was committed to a ‘hard order’ of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.Galanis is seeking home confinement after claiming sexual assault in prisonGalanis acknowledged that in an effort to build Burnham, he engaged in unlawful conduct and betrayed the trust of union members’ pension fund money.I pleaded guilty. I have had eight years in federal custody to reflect on my actions, and I am profoundly sorry for my role, he said.Archer was also indicted in the scheme, but Hunter Biden was not. Galanis testified he believed the federal prosecution strategy was intended to protect Hunter Biden and, ultimately, Vice President Biden.Galanis has applied for and been denied home confinement. Galanis said that beginning in January 2023, he was sexually assaulted by a member of prison staff at FPC Pensacola. He testified that he was hoping home confinement would remove me from the danger.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI believe that based on the events I have described, much of which is memorialized in writing, I have been the victim of a pattern of retribution by the Department of Justice in order to prevent my home confinement, which would have allowed full and free access to congressional investigators, he said.Galanis said that from his experiences in the justice system, he believes he is putting himself at grave risk within the BOP for providing information on these matters concerning the president and his son.

NOW THERES ‘NO CODE’ CURBING RUTHLESSNESS: EXPERTIts all horrifying to us, but to people in Mexico, its just a Tuesday. This happens all the time all over the country, Armes said. But now its happening in areas that used to be off limits.About 15 to 20 years ago, the heads of the cartels lived by a code similar to the Italian mob, the renowned PI said.In the old days, you werent allowed to target women or children. You werent allowed to encroach on another cartels territory. And the resorts were off limits. … Cartels wanted to fly under the radar as much as they could, said Armes.AMERICAN KIDNAPPED IN MEXICO, LEFT TO DIE IN JUNGLE WITH EYES, WRISTS TAPEDA slain foreigner in a tourist area, especially an American, brought unwanted attention and mandatory, swift action from the Mexican government, military and law enforcement, Armes said.Government leaders wanted to protect tourism, which has been the countrys legal economic foundation for decades.In 2022 alone, there were 66 million international visitors, including nearly 34 million U.S. tourists, according to Mexicos ministry of tourism and statista, respectively.Most of the travelers arrived through Cancun International Airport, which received 36.1% of all incoming flight passengers, according to a January report by travelinglifestyle.net, to vacation along the gorgeous, white sand beaches, thinking they were insulated from cartel violence.MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARREST 6 IN CONNECTION TO GRISLY MACHETE MURDERS IN CANCUNIn reality, theyve become war zones.The rules have changed, Armes said. All that old guard code is out the window. The resorts are open shop.The rules have changed. All that old guard code is out the window. The resorts are open shop.He noted how travel bloggers and social media influencers have attracted an influx of travelers that the gangs have never seen before.Who we see as tourists are potential customers or potential victims to the cartels, Armes said. Even if its 1% or 5% (of tourists to the resort areas), thats millions of customers and a big chunk of business.WATCH: SHOOTOUT BETWEEN CARTELS AND MEXICAN AUTHORITIESFour main cartels want all the business in those areas. That includes El Chapos old cartel, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Gulf Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and the Grupo Regional, a smaller cartel created by former Zetas, brutally violent cartel enforcers, Armes said.With all these young kids coming up (through the cartel ranks), theres no respect for anything, he said. Its become a free-for-all.CALIFORNIA WOMAN SHOT DEAD IN MEXICAN RESORT TOWN POPULAR WITH AMERICANSAnd travelers are sucked into the violence, either as targets for robberies or sex trafficking or as innocent bystanders in the wrong place at the wrong time.One of the unfortunate byproducts of the drug wars and drug trafficking is, inevitably, some innocent person is going to get caught in the crossfire when the cartels are shooting each other, Armes said.Thats what happened to 44-year-old Los Angeles native Niko Honarbakhsh, according to the Quintana Roo State Attorney General’s Office.On Feb. 9, Honarbakhsh was killed, along with a drug dealer from Belize who had cocaine and transparent bags with red and orange pills as well as bags with brown granulated powder in his possession when he was killed, the local Mexican AGs office said.4 BUS AND TAXI DRIVERS SHOT TO DEATH IN VIOLENT SOUTHERN MEXICO CITYThats different from the men who were hacked to death in Cancun, Armes said.That was violence among drug traffickers. That was a very public killing that was meant to be a warning, he said. When they leave the bodies to be found in the trunk of a car, inside a car on the street, in a public place hanging from a bridge, a cartel is sending a message to a rival cartel or put fear into the politicians.Violence makes Mayan ruins unreachableAnother popular tourist hot spot is the Mayan ruins in the Mexican state of Chiapas, about 700 miles east of the Caribbean Coast resorts near the Guatamalan border.Theyve virtually been cut off by cartel violence, the Mexican government admitted, according to a Jan. 27 report by The Associated Press.GANG VIOLENCE IN MEXICO MAKING SOME MAYAN RUIN SITES UNREACHABLE, MEXICAN GOVERNMENT SAYSTwo tourist guides in Chiapas, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity, said two other sites the Mexican government claims are still open to visitors can only be reached by passing though drug gang checkpoints.It’s as if you told me to go to the Gaza Strip, right? one of the guides told the AP.They take your cellphone and demand your sign-in code, and then they look through your conversations to see if you belong to some other gang, the guide said.At any given time, a rival group could show up and start a gun battle.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe government and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador have been downplaying gang violence, but starting around December, tourists have canceled about 5% of trips booked for the area.Politicians pretending people arent being killed at an exponential rate or downplaying the violence is a major component of the entangled, complex web in Mexico that basically gives the cartels immunity, Armes said.Fox News Digitals Mitch Picasso contributed to this report.

In fact, as the frequency and severity of destructive weather events have increased, more areas are considered high risk and unprofitable for insurance companies, the report said.HIGH INFLATION IS STILL SQUEEZING AMERICANS BUDGETSA growing number of insurance companies are opting to leave states like California and Florida, driving prices even higher for homeowners.Heres a look at where you can expect to pay the highest premium for home insurance.FloridaFlorida is the most expensive state for home insurance, with the average annual cost rising $9,213 last year. That is 421% higher than the national average.Rates jumped by 14% in 2023 as several major insurers stopped renewing certain policies or left the state entirely, citing concerns over hurricane risk. Severe weather damages in Florida topped $15 billion last year.PROPERTY INSURANCE GOING UP OR AWAY FOR MANY IN BREWING CRISISOklahomaHome insurance in Oklahoma costs about $4,782 on average, 170% higher than what the typical American pays. Premiums rose 24% in the state last year, Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready has blamed the increase on weather and the rising cost of building materials due to inflation.The median home value in Oklahoma is nearly 50% lower than the national average, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, Insurify wrote in the report. However, with insurance rates surging, homeownership in Oklahoma isn’t as attainable as property values suggest.MississippiHomeowners in Mississippi saw an average insurance rate of 23% last year, with the annual cost hitting $4,017. That is roughly 127% higher than the national average.Insurify said the increase is likely the result of what the National Weather Service called unprecedented, historically destructive severe weather that ran through the Deep South over the summer.Insurance rates in the state increased 433% more than income in the state in 2023.TexasTexas insurance rates rose 18% in 2023, 452% more than wage growth in the state and 124% higher than the national insurance rate.THE NUMBER OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS IS DWINDLINGThe Lone Star State also experienced a number of severe weather events last year, including 16 that caused more than $1 billion in damage apiece.Home insurance in Texas now costs about $3,969 on average.KansasHome insurance rates jumped 19% in Kansas last year to an average of $3,245. That is 83% higher than the national average.HAVE KIDS?

By comparison, the median household income in the state rose just 2.3% last year, according to Labor Department data.Georgia experienced 12 natural disasters last year that cost the state about $38 billion in damages.NebraskaHomeowner insurance in Nebraska is nearly twice as expensive as the national average.

Tom Cotton torches Google AI system as racist, preposterously woke, Hamas-sympathizing;Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., slammed Googles AI chatbot Gemini as preposterously woke on Friday for its refusal to produce any images of White people.The company paused the chatbots image generation on Thursday after social media users pointed out that the system was creating inaccurate historical images that sometimes replaced White people, like the Founding Fathers, with images of Black, Native American and Asian people.Google deserves condemnation for creating a racist, preposterously woke, Hamas-sympathizing AI system, Cotton said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. Republican lawmakers will remember this the next time Google comes asking for antitrust help.Cotton pointed out that the problem also lies at the White House, which pushed an executive order last year that bolsters AI safety and security, protects Americans’ privacy, advances equity and civil rights, according to an October Biden-Harris fact sheet.This debacle is a good reminder of why federal control over AI would be a disaster, Cotton continued. It would force every AI system to be as broken and as dishonest as Googles.GOOGLE TO PAUSE GEMINI IMAGE GENERATION AFTER AI REFUSES TO SHOW IMAGES OF WHITE PEOPLEOn Wednesday, Google apologized for the errors.Were aware that Gemini is offering inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions, Google said on Wednesday.Gemini, formerly known as Google Bard, is one of many multimodal large language models (LLMs) currently available to the public. As is the case with all LLMs, the human-like responses offered by these AIs can change from user to user. Based on contextual information, the language and tone of the prompter, and training data used to create the AI responses, each answer can be different, even if the question is the same.GOOGLE APOLOGIZES AFTER NEW GEMINI AI REFUSES TO SHOW PICTURES, ACHIEVEMENTS OF WHITE PEOPLEIn a statement to Fox News Digital, Gemini Experiences Senior Director of Product Management Jack Krawczyk addressed the responses from the AI that had led social media users to voice concern.Were working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately, Krawczyk said. Geminis AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And thats generally a good thing, because people around the world use it. But its missing the mark here.Prior to Krawczyks tenure with Google, he allegedly tweeted that white privilege is f—king real and America is rampant with egregious racism, according to posts circulating on X that appear to be his.White privilege is f—king real, Krawczyk allegedly wrote in a tweet on April 13, 2018, according to screenshots on X. Don’t be an a—hole and act guilty about it – do your part in recognizing bias at all levels of egregious.One alleged post, which Elon Musk also shared a picture of, referenced President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris .Ive been crying in intermittent bursts for the past 24 hours since casting my ballot.

The killer, 30-year-old Moses Jacob Lopez, reportedly killed Lawhon after the pair arrived at an incorrect address during the ride.Lopez, who identifies as transgender, accepted a plea deal for the stabbing and was sentenced to 22 years behind bars. Campbell said Lopez did not show remorse at the sentencing hearing to Lawhons family and friends.OPEN-AIR DRUG USE, OVERDOSES PUSH DEMOCRATS TO INTRODUCE OVERHAUL OF FIRST-IN-THE-NATION DECRIMINALIZATION LAWHe went on for 12 full minutes of nothing but excuses, and never an apology, and we came out of the courtroom extraordinarily angry, Campbell told Carley Shimkus during Fox & Friends First.There was just a handful of friends and co-workers who were in the courtroom, and it was just dumbfounding.Im one of just a handful of people outside of the detectives and the DAs office that actually saw the video and witnessed the murder, he continued.And it is horrific. Its something that I see every single day when I wake up in the morning, and there was… no need for that kind of violence, and this is something that, Moses got off on. I firmly believe that. I see his face every day.Lopez was seen smirking in the courtroom Wednesday as the sentence was handed down.I refuse to apologize for the lack of help I so desperately needed and called and asked for from 911 services, said Lopez.Lawhons family told FOX 12 that they decided to accept the plea deal because they did not want to have to endure a trial.Campbell argued the defense teams portrayal of Lopezs 911 call was very misleading. Lopez claimed to be having a mental health episode that prompted the call to 911.That 911 call is frustrating because they make it sound like he called asking for mental health treatment, Campbell said.VOTERS’ REMORSE: BLUE STATE SURVEY SHOWS MAJORITY WANT TO RE-CRIMINALIZE DRUGS: WE MADE AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE[The ride] started, in a very popular, clubbing area in downtown and ended up in a warehouse district, and it was about a seven-minute trip. There wasnt a single word spoken until they got down there, Campbell said, adding that Lawhon was then told by Lopez that it was the wrong location.You can see Reese put another address into his GPS and begin to drive. They were starting to move, and out of nowhere, [Lopez] just pulls a knife and sticks it in his neck.The New York Post reported Lopezs legal team blamed a tumultuous upbringing and being forced to leave home at a very young age as excuses for the crime.Carley Shimkus noted that Lawhon, who was adopted and remembered as a caring and talented musician, was set to meet his biological parents before he was killed.

Gavin Newsom and joked about Californians potentially fleeing his state on a high-speed rail line as speculation continues to swirl over whether Newsom could replace Biden in the 2024 presidential race.Biden, speaking at the White House during a meeting of the National Governors Association, said, Were building the nations first high speed rail line in California and Nevada and I want to thank Governor Newsom for his leadership on that.And by the way, Im not sure how many people who leave L.A. can do it in two hours to get there, or whether theyre going to come back or not, Biden joked.The Nevada Department of Transportation says the planned $12 billion Las Vegas-to-Los Angeles high-speed rail system aims to shuttle passengers between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga in two hours and 10 minutes on trains that travel at more than 186 miles per hour.JOE ROGAN SAYS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ‘SETTING UP GAVIN NEWSOM’ FOR 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUNThe journey would be twice as fast as the standard drive time, and officials are planning on breaking ground on the project early this year in hopes of completing it in time for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, the department added.Podcast host Joe Rogan has become one of the latest figures to speculate on whether the Democratic Party is preparing to swap out Biden with Newsom on this year’s presidential ticket.RAND PAUL: ‘NEVER, EVER LET GAVIN NEWSOM ANYWHERE NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE’Don’t you think that that’s a ruse, him running for president?

Mayor Muriel Bowser distributed thousands of dollars to low-income moms with no strings attached as part of an equitable economic recovery strategy to offset the costs of childcare. In at least one case, the taxpayer dollars were used to fund a lavish trip to Miami.The direct cash payments were part of a pilot program to determine whether the flush of cash could demonstrate economic improvements among participants. Additional cash has allowed women to achieve further financial stability, financial security, food security, and health insurance coverage, Bowsers office had claimed.But an economic policy expert told Fox News Digital the policies were a misdirection of funds that should otherwise be used for public safety and education.All 132 mothers who participated in the program were able to choose whether to receive monthly payments of $900 or to get $10,800 in a lump sum, which was a unique feature of D.C.’s pilot, according to The Washington Post.WELCOME TO HARVARD, WHERE YOU CAN SPEND $317,800 TO LEARN ABOUT QUEERING THE WORLD, THREESOME DATING APPSQuite often these handouts actually trap people in a cycle of poverty, Joel Griffith, an economic research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. This is not helping people build long-term wealth and to have long-term economic prosperity.One recipient – Canethia Miller – told The Post that she took the money and spent most of it on a lavish trip to Miami.Some of it I just left alone. The other side is, I wanted to blow it. I wanted to have fun, Miller said. [My kids] got to experience something I would never have been able to do if I didn’t have that money.Miller blew it on a five-day, $6,000 trip to Miami, which included a boat tour [that] exposed them to million-dollar homes and luxury yachts.In what she called a rare moment of self-indulgence, Miller spent $180 ahead of the vacation to get her own hair and nails done, The Post reported. She also took her kids shopping and got them new outfits and toys for the trip.Griffith said that the D.C. mayor would have been better off spending money on reducing crime.Spending money on what effectively is a lotto for city residents is the wrong thing to be doing. I think what parents want, whether single moms, single dads or married couples, is a safe city, he added. What the mayor could do is take these resources that theyre going to be distributing randomly to single moms. And you could hire, by my calculations, 25 full-time police officers. That would go a long way in some of these neighborhoods where you cant even walk safely at night.In January 2022, Democratic Mayor Bowser allocated $1.5 million to a direct cash transfer pilot program called Strong Families, Strong Future DC that was intended to support maternal health and advance economic mobility.This program is about supporting new and expectant moms with cash so that they can have the autonomy and flexibility to make the best choices for them and their baby, Bowser said.The Strong Families, Strong Future DC pilot was at the heart of our equitable economic recovery strategy, Bowser added.DEMOCRATIC MAYOR ACCUSED OF ANTICS SO WILD SHE DESERVES HER OWN TV SHOW: REAL LIFE PARKS & REC SITUATIONOBAMA JUDGE RULES CRT TRAININGS CAN VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW AFTER IT TRAUMATIZED WHITE TEACHERBut some of the issues arose when the mothers were uncertain about how to spend the cash.Building generational wealth generally requires a solid educational background, which in D.C. is lackluster, Griffith said.[As a resident of D.C.], youre likely to graduate with a subpar education. And were talking about sometimes an inability to do basic math and basic reading comprehension. And those are the core skills that in a work ethic that allow people to succeed in this country, even if they dont come from a wealthy family, he added.Miller seemed to share a similar sentiment when she told The Post, A lot of communities in my area don’t know the financial gain of credit, saving for your kids, that’s why we’re broke, that’s why we don’t have nothing to pass down or no house to give down. I’m trying to get to the level where I’m passing something down that really matters, so I can be set and my kids can be set, and they don’t need to push so hard like I’m doing now.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAltogether, Miller saved $50 from the program.She opened up a savings account, aiming to keep at least $50 in it. She used the remaining $4,000 or so from the pilot in a matter of months, mostly on bills and a used car, The Washington Post reported.
212;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/swing-state-residents-reap-benefits-biden-student-loan-handout;Swing state residents reap benefits of Biden student loan handout;More than 25,000 borrowers in six key swing states are set to have over $200 million in student loan debt canceled thanks to President Biden.The Biden-Harris administration on Friday released a state-by-state breakdown of the nearly 153,000 borrowers who will benefit from the latest round of loan cancelation under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan.When we talk about fixing a broken student loan system, this is what we’re talking about, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The state-by-state SAVE Plan debt forgiveness numbers we’re announcing today not only show that President Biden’s leadership is making a real impact on people’s lives in every state — they demonstrate that we won’t ever stop fighting to make higher education more affordable and accessible for more Americans.This is that commitment in action. This is the real deal, the secretary said.BIDEN CANCELS $1.2 BILLION IN STUDENT DEBT SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULEThe numbers show highly-populated states, like solid-blue California, are getting the most cash. California, Texas and Florida will receive a combined $336.8 million in debt cancellation, but residents of states that are key to Bidens re-election effort will also receive substantial debt relief.The six states that may determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Former President Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 because of his surprise victories in the traditionally Democratic-leaning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden narrowly flipped those states in 2020, along with Georgia and Arizona, winning the White House by a combined 42,844 votes across three of those states.SOME STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE BOYCOTTING PAYMENTS, BUT THE RISK IS HIGH: SURVEYAccording to the Education Department, 3,990 borrowers in Arizona stand to have $33 million in debt canceled, 6,050 in Georgia will have $49.7 million in debt forgiven, and 1,990 in Wisconsin will get $13.8 million in debt relief.Student loan relief was a pillar of Bidens 2020 presidential campaign, and some progressives still say the president has fallen short by not eliminating all federal student debt.US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUPPORTS COLLEGES AND STUDENTS AMID FAFSA DELAYSIn June, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that federal law does not allow Bidens Secretary of Education to cancel more than $430 billion in student loan debt. Biden promised at the time that his administration would continue to push for his student debt relief plan.On Wednesday, he announced that borrowers enrolled in his SAVE plan who have been in repayment for at least 10 years and hold $12,000 or less in student loan debt will have those loans canceled. Those with larger debts will receive relief after an additional year of payments for every additional $1,000 they borrowed.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESSPresident Biden has so far unilaterally wiped away nearly $138 billion in federal student loans for almost 3.9 million borrowers without a single act of Congress.Republicans have vowed to undo Bidens student debt handouts, arguing that taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill for the presidents contributions to the $34 trillion national debt .Fox News Remy Numa contributed to this report.

Among them are hire more black teachers and fund counselors not cops.A preview page of the book on Amazon says the principles show ways we can use new systems, like restorative justice and Black villages, instead of old systems, like the police and neighborhoods that make it hard for Black people to create community.Under the books Transgender Affirming section, it instructs students to read the book ‘When Aidan Became a Brother’ about a girl who transitions to a boy, and then answer questions on a worksheet like, ‘How do you feel when someone tells you what you can or can’t do based on your gender? according to The Free Press report.Another preview page says, We make space for transgender people to participate and lead. We know that cisgender (not trans) people in our society have privilege, and we want to uplift trans people, especially black trans women who often experience violence.BLACK LIVES MATTER DONATIONS DRASTICALLY PLUMMETED BY NEARLY $70 MILLIONOne parent of a fourth grader, whose grandparents The Free Press says fled from communist China, took issue with the coloring books use of the word comrade.Using the word comrades comes from Communist times, the parent told The Free Press. They are using words that I don’t think are appropriate for elementary school.The parent reportedly only learned of the coloring book last week because her daughter was forced to learn remotely due to a snow day, telling The Free Press, This is classwork, not homework.If it weren’t for the snow, we wouldn’t have known, the parent said.INDIANA PARENTS WARN NATION AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM HOME FOR IMPROPER PRONOUN USAGE: CAN HAPPEN ANYWHEREAnother parent, whose family fled from the Soviet Union, similarly said the text from the coloring book reminds her of the songs we were made to sing as elementary school children. ‘Dismantling’ and ‘comrade’ and everything—it really reminds me of the word salad that was a part of those songs.The parent compared Black Lives Matter to communism, telling The Free Press, same salad, different dressing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPS 321 William Penn did not immediately respond to Fox News Digitals requests for comment.

Przybyla began. Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainline evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced, you know, real estate mogul who had cheated on his wife with a porn star and all of that. So what happened was he was surrounded by this more extremist element. Theyre gonna hear words like ‘Christian nationalism, like the ‘New Apostolic reformation.’ These are groups that you should get very, very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trumps circle.CNN REPORTER ASKS BIDEN IF NAVALNYS BLOOD IS ‘ON THE HANDS OF REPUBLICANS’ FOR BLOCKING UKRAINE AIDThe thing that unites them as Christian nationalists - not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different - is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, dont come from any earthly authority. They dont come from Congress, they dont come from the Supreme Court. They come from God. The problem with that is that they are determining- man, men, it is men are determining what God is telling them, Przybyla said.And in the past, that so-called natural law is, you know, its a pillar of Catholicism, for instance. It has been used for good in social justice campaigns, Martin Luther King evoked it in talking about civil rights, but now you have an extremist element of conservative Christians who say that this applies specifically to issues including abortion, gay marriage, and its going much further than that, she continued, before citing the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF.A portion of Przybylas comments, especially the ones talking about how Christian nationalists believe rights come from God not government, went viral on Friday with many critics accusing her of attacking Christians and being ignorant of basic American civics.The Declaration of Independence cites the Laws of Nature and of Natures God and says, We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.JAMES CARVILLE: ‘CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS’ LIKE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON ARE A ‘BIGGER THREAT THAN AL-QAEDA’Here @MSNBC helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America, Wade Miller of Citizens for Renewing America said while sharing the clip of Przybyla. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this proclamation, as have most Americans throughout our history. The radical Atheist Globalists are coming to try to crush ordinary American citizens.Our Declaration of Independence, our entire system of government, is based on the principle that our rights don’t come from some earthly authority (like Congress or a king) but from God. Read the plain words of the Declaration: ‘We are endowed by our CREATOR with certain inalienable rights.’ The historical illiteracy of her comments is stunning, Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen added.Imagine going on TV and being this ignorant while having this level of self assurance, New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz reacted. Liberal privilege, man. We hold these truths to be self-evident but only if Congress and the Supreme Court agree!MSNBCS MATTHEW DOWD: ‘WHITE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM’ ENGULFED REPUBLICAN PARTY POLITICS AND RELIGIONHas @HeidiReports read the Declaration of Independence? Daily Caller deputy editor Ailan Evans asked.But Przybyla remained defiant on Friday.That is NOT what I said & you know it. Why dont you play the full clip? Przybyla reacted to Millers viral post of her comments. I said men are making their own policy interpretation of natural law. MLK did so w social justice. Youre welcome to as well but you dont speak for all Christians & certainly not for God.She later added, While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God. If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda… which distinguishes this from other Christians who leave these God-given rights at our inherent right to ‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ -- vs banning abortion, contraception etc.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn response to Fox News Digitals request for comment, Przybyla pointed to the full clip of her remarks and did not comment further. Politico did not immediately respond for comment.Earlier in the week, Przybyla co-authored a report claiming that top allies of former President Trump are ready to infuse Christian nationalism into a second administration if hes elected, spearheaded by his former White House budget director and current president of the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America Russell Vought.

That means 99%, 99% of cyberattacks go un-prosecuted. So the cyberattacks are going to continue, he added, and somebody is dropping the ball. And in this case, its the government.Early Thursday morning, AT&T service suffered a nationwide outage most prominently impacting Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Miami service areas. A U.S. defense official told FOX News on Thursday that there was no indication it was a cyberattack.PHARMACIES SCRAMBLE TO SERVE SICK CUSTOMERS AS ‘NATION-STATE’ BLAMED FOR ONGOING CYBERATTACK OUTAGEAnd while the FBI and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said they began investigating the outages, pharmacies across the country reported delays by early Thursday afternoon to prescription orders due to a cyberattack against one of the nations largest healthcare technology companies, Change Healthcare.Change Healthcare, which handles orders and patient payments throughout the U.S., first noticed the cyber security issue affecting its networks Wednesday morning on the East Coast before disconnecting its systems.Most cyberattacks take about 280 days to trace where they are, what happened, Szabo noted. We have learned that this is likely a foreign encounter.This isnt new, the legal expert further warned. We saw Sony get hacked by North Korea. We saw the Colonial Pipeline shut down just a couple of years ago with these ransomware attacks. Were seeing ransomware attacks against our hospitals. What we need is law enforcement to go out and do its job. We need less talk, more prosecutions.Szabo recommended Americans take technological precautions to ensure their personal information is protected against a future cyberattack.Make sure you secure your personal email. Use unique passwords. Activate two-factor authentication because until the government steps up and starts doing its job, he said, we need to secure ourselves.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREAT&T apologized to customers Thursday for the outage and said it likely came from a software error. On the other hand, Change Healthcare has not given a definitive timeline for a return to service, but said outages are expected to last through Friday.This is why America needs to continue to be the leader in technological dominance in the world.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.Reports are saying that Meghan Markle has extended an olive branch to Princess Kate Middleton, but some royal watchers arent buying it.This allegation is not true, Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, told Fox News Digital. Meghan Markle has not been in contact with the Princess of Wales. As the princess is currently in recovery, it would be a highly inappropriate time for Meghan to do any outreach.Catherine is currently dipping her toes back into her routine, Schofield said, navigating light communication, i.e. emails, approving scheduling and household duties. Having to navigate the hurricane that is Meghan Markle is not on her agenda.PRINCE HARRYS LATEST TV TELL-ALL RAISES CONCERN ABOUT KING CHARLES HEALTHThe Daily Mirror in the U.K. recently reported that Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, reached out to her sister-in-law after Markles husband, Prince Harry, traveled across the pond to visit his father, King Charles III, after the new monarch was recently diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer.The outlet said that Markle, an American former actress, contacted the princess and moves are being made behind the scenes.A source also told Us Weekly that Markle attempted peace talks with Princess Kate, 42, and her father-in-law.Moves are being made to reconcile, the insider told the outlet. Another source said, Meghan is supportive of Harry in all of this, and she wishes the royals – Kate included – the very best.Schofield isnt fazed.Meghan Markle and the Princess of Wales will never be friends, Schofield said. Prince Harry solidified that with the publication of his memoir, ‘Spare,’ although Meghan Markle originally crossed the line with the … complaints disguised as being the bigger person via the Oprah Winfrey interview. Despite the betrayal, Harry will always have a place in Catherine’s heart because she … knew a very different Harry.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERThere is no love lost with Meghan Markle, Schofield added.During her sit-down with Winfrey in 2021, Markle, now 42, addressed reports that she left Princess Kate in tears leading up to her 2018 royal wedding due to a disagreement over bridesmaid dresses.The reverse happened, said the former Suits star.And I don’t say that to be disparaging to anyone, because it was a really hard week of the wedding, and she was upset about something, Markle continued. But she owned it, and she apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing. I actually think it’s – I don’t think it’s fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologized. And I’ve forgiven her.Markle described Princess Kate as a good person and said people shouldn’t pit them against each other.If you love me, you don’t have to hate her, said Markle. And if you love her, you don’t have to hate me.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn Jan. 29, Buckingham Palace announced that Princess Kate had left a private London hospital where she had been staying for weeks. The mother of three had abdominal surgery for an undisclosed condition. It was the same central London hospital where the king, 75, went to treat an enlarged prostate.On Feb. 5, the palace announced that the king was diagnosed with cancer and had started treatment. The palace noted that the cancer is not related to his benign prostate condition.Royal photographer and broadcaster Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that rumors of Markle attempting to reconcile with Princess Kate are not true.Meghan’s track record of building bridges with her own family and friends is pretty much non-existent, she said. It is, however, in Meghan’s interest to show compassion, humility and make amends with the British royal family as both Harry and Meghan heavily lean on their royal titles. I’m sure Meghan would also like to win back some fans.Harry has let it be known that Meghan shares his concerns for the king and Kate Middleton as they both cope with serious health issues, Christopher Andersen, author of The King, also told Fox News Digital.That said, there is no indication that either side is ‘reaching out’ to the other in any significant way, he said. People are understandably glomming onto any vague sign that Harry and Meghan will be welcomed back into the bosom of the royal family. So far, there is no credible evidence that a thaw seems to be happening, especially not between Meghan and Kate.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSOn Feb. 12, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex quietly launched their new Sussex website. It encompasses the latest news about the pair as well as links to the Archewell Foundation organization and Archewell Productions hub. The website also includes Markle’s coat of arms, which incorporates Harry’s crest.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that whether the reports are true or not, it would make sense for the couple to attempt peace talks.It makes great sense to me to have Harry and Meghan back, he said. They have a … star quality similar to the late Princess Grace of Monaco. They also ... have a common touch in their DNA, which is what all the photo opportunities and PR messaging the royal family is trying to establish. It is a work in progress.I’m sure … Meghan can forgive the defamatory stories and support her sister-in-law, he shared.Harry has had a troubled relationship with his family since he quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to California with his wife, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. He showed up alone for his father’s coronation in May but left as soon as the ceremony ended to return to the U.S. for his son’s birthday.Following their departure as senior royals, Harry and his wife aired their complaints about life as royals. In 2021, they sat down with Winfrey for an interview that was viewed by 50 million people globally. After releasing a six-part docuseries on Netflix in 2022, Harry’s memoir, Spare, hit bookshelves in 2023, quickly becoming a bestseller.MEGHAN MARKLE, KATE MIDDLETONS RELATIONSHIP IS NONEXISTENT, THEY WERE NEVER FRIENDSTrue Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen previously told Fox News Digital that the royal wives were never friends.There wasn’t really any relationship between the two of them, said Bullen. It was the brothers – Prince William and Prince Harry – who were falling out, not the sisters-in-law, not the wives.Bullen is an award-winning documentarian who has been producing programs about the British royal family for 20 years. He has also worked closely with the king for about a decade.Bullen said that despite the women putting on a brave face for the public, it was difficult for them to develop any kind of bond behind palace doors.I was talking to someone very early on in the Sussex marriage who had been at a dinner with Kate and had been asking about Meghan, Bullen said. And Kate just said, ‘She’s just really different [from] the rest of us,’ and not in a negative way. They just didn’t have lots in common.Kate is sort of a well-to-do English girl who hadn’t really had many jobs and had married her prince, he said. Whereas Meghan was a divorced career woman from L.A. They’re just different. So, I think the relationship … was never really there as we, as the world, were hoping. We hoped it would be those shots of them going to Wimbledon together. … [But] you’d be hard [pressed] to find moments when it was just the two of them coming together.PRINCE HARRYS ROYAL RETURN UNLIKELY AS PRINCE WILLIAM SIMMERS WITH RAGE: EXPERTBullen added that the little relationship the wives had developed had broken down long before the death of the queen.Queen Elizabeth II, Britains longest-reigning monarch, died in 2022 at age 96.I think after the death of the queen, there wasn’t really a relationship to break down, said Bullen. I don’t think it was there in the first place.

These reforms made America a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants and the strongest economy in the world, Biden said to members of the National Governors Association at the White House. But something changed. Over time, our laws and our resources havent kept up with our immigration system, and its broken. And our politics has failed to fix it.The White House has called on Republicans to back a bipartisan Senate bill that would have increased staffing and resources at the border while limiting the ability of migrants to claim asylum and providing additional funding to communities and NGOs receiving migrants. However, conservatives have said the bill does not go far enough and would normalize high levels of illegal immigration.FEDERAL JUDGE TORCHES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR ‘COLLUDING’ WITH ACTIVIST GROUP ON ASYLUM RULEBiden described the bill Friday as representing the most fair and humane reforms in a long time.I didnt get everything I wanted in it.

Mortgage applications are as low as they’ve been since 1995. And then we’ve got no supply, he said during his appearance on The Claman Countdown Wednesday.Umansky said we should not expect to see prices drop until we start seeing some pain and some supply.BEVERLY HILLS HOME RENOVATIONS BLOCKED OVER LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSINGUntil we start seeing the pain and prices drop, I don’t see the government dropping interest rates. So, we really need to allow the markets to be markets, and for affordability to start happening so that the government starts dropping interest rates again, he said.When asked about the reasons behind the lack of inventory in the housing market, Umansky cited a decline in home building, buyers and sellers refusing to move due to their existing home mortgage and hedge funds buying single-family homes.In December, Democrats introduced the End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act. The bill imposes an excise tax on hedge fund taxpayers that own a certain number of single-family residence[s] in excess of a specified amount. The effort also establishes the Housing Down Payment Trust Fund into which tax revenues from this bill shall be deposited to provide grants for down payment assistance to taxpayers purchasing a single-family residence.FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS SHOULD CHECK THESE CITIES PER REALTOR.COMDespite being a proponent of free capitalism, Umansky suggested that government intervention may be necessary as Wall Street investors continue their single-family home buying sprees.The government does have to get involved a little bit and perhaps, you know, figure out some way of limiting the way that the hedge funds are able to do this, because right now in Middle America, they [hedge funds] are just eating up so much product that there’s just no supply hitting the market, he stressed.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

They’ve seen snakes they reckon were over 8 meters and 800 kilograms. So, its clear that the snakes in the Waorani lands are indeed the biggest of all anacondas.Fry called the expedition into the heart of the Amazon a true cross-cultural endeavor.The explorer was invited by Waorani Chief Penti Baihua to enter the Baihuaeri Waorani Territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon for this research.The invitation was reportedly one of only a handful granted since the tribe’s first contact in 1958, according to Fry.It was a real honor.NEW YORK MAN WHO SMUGGLED PYTHONS INTO THE US BY HIDING THEM IN HIS PANTS SENTENCED TO PROBATION, FINED $5KFry and the Waorani collaborators were recognized as co-authors in the journal publication of the study, which Fry considers a career-defining moment.[It’s] a testament to the surprises that the natural world still holds, he said.The success of this expedition and the inclusion of Waorani as equal partners really underscores the essence of what it means to be an explorer, he added.The Amazon offered a kaleidoscope of challenges and wonders, Fry said, including the surroundings of dense canopy above … and the rivers below, serpentine paths cutting through the darkness of the jungle floor.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTEROur expedition was marked by the relentless heat, the omnipresent swarm of insects, and the symphony of the wild that crescendoed into the night, Fry said.I like nothing better than being overheated and underwashed while wading through swamps in search of giant snakes.The discovery also serves as a stark reminder of the threats faced by the Amazon, including deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change and oil spills, which place this new species and the entire ecosystem in jeopardy, Fry went on.Although this discovery was a breakthrough, Fry said the teams work in the Amazon is far from complete, as it continues to study the impact of frequent oil spills in the region.Our expedition was marked by the relentless heat, the omnipresent swarm of insects, and the symphony of the wild that crescendoed into the night.Our future expeditions will focus on the collection and analysis of soil, water and biological samples, employing cutting-edge techniques to trace the pathways of these contaminants, he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMore on this discovery can be found at natgeo.com.

He couldn’t even afford college.But in 1944, he directed one of the landmark procedures in the history of heart medicine.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO MADE FLYING SAFE, ARCHIE LEAGUE, DAREDEVIL PILOT AND FIRST AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERThomas guided his mentor, Dr. Alfred Blalock, in the first successful operation to repair the heart of a baby suffering Tetralogy of Fallot – better known as blue-baby syndrome.Blalock knew what he had, and what he had was a Michael Jordan of surgery in his lab, said Dr. Koco Eaton, Thomas’ nephew, in a telephone interview with Fox News Digital.Eaton is the team physician for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball.Dr. Blalock was the chief of surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, one of the nation’s most renowned doctors.Yet he entrusted his career, the future of cardiac surgery and the life of the 18-month-old baby to the direction of a former carpenter with a high-school diploma.What he had was a Michael Jordan of surgery in his lab.Eaton said his humble uncle never discussed his career at the forefront of cardiac surgery.He only learned of Thomas’ prestige when his uncle volunteered to drive him to his medical school interview at Johns Hopkins in the early 1980s.Thomas’ portrait hung on the wall. He was greeted warmly, even reverently, by school staff.Eaton grew up attending July 4th family cookouts at Thomas’ Baltimore, Maryland home.Only after walking in the shadow of his uncle did Eaton realize there was something special about the man sweating over the grill on Independence Day.The tongs he used to flip the hot dogs and hamburgers were modified surgical clamps he designed himself, said Eaton.Thomas had the audacity to build a better spatula.He also had the talent to teach the worlds best surgeons how to stitch new life into the dying hearts of infants.Postdoctoral researcher paid as a janitorVivien Theodore Thomas was born on Aug. 29, 1910 to Willard Maceo and Mary Alice (Eaton) Thomas in Lake Providence or New Iberia, Louisiana.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO TAUGHT THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN TO FLY: PIONEER PILOT CHARLES ‘CHIEF’ ANDERSONHe was raised in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating with honors from Pearl High School in 1929.He worked as a carpenter and harbored dreams of attending college and then medical school.The world had different ideas. The stock market crash of 1929 wiped out his college savings, Thomas wrote in his autobiography.He instead found work as a research assistant for Dr. Blalock at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.He proved an intuitive scientist and surgeon.Thomas rapidly mastered complex surgical techniques and research methodology.Thomas rapidly mastered complex surgical techniques and research methodology, the school writes in an online biography.Because of institutional racism, the institution admits today, Thomas was classified, and paid, as a janitor, despite the fact that by the mid-1930s he was doing the work of a postdoctoral researcher in Blalock’s lab.Still, Thomas’ genius could not be contained by title or numbers on a paystub.Because of his mechanical aptitude, said Eaton, he could take Blalock’s ideas and make them a reality.German bombing raids over the United Kingdom in the early days of World War II, meanwhile, amplified the need to address a phenomenon known as Crush syndrome.Crushing injuries to limbs set off a chain reaction in the body that caused heart failure.Thomas and Blalock did groundbreaking research into the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock, Vanderbilt reports.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORKThis work later evolved into research on Crush syndrome and saved the lives of thousands of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II.Blalock was offered the position of chief of surgery at his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, in 1941.He insisted his gifted research partner make the move with him.Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating upon the heart, Vanderbilt adds.Legendary day in medicineEllen Saxon was just 18 months old, suffering from a fatal heart defect commonly known as blue baby syndrome, when she was presented on a surgery table before Dr. Blalock.It was Nov. 29, 1944, a landmark day in the history of heart surgery.Up to that day, most infants and children with Tetralogy of Fallot had in fact no hope for cure, Johns Hopkins writes in its online account of the event.But Thomas had perfected the technique to repair the defective hearts, Eaton said, during hundreds of demonstrations and experiments he performed on dogs.The exercises revealed that new devices were needed to make the surgery successful. Thomas conceived, designed and crafted them.Among his innovations was a clamp of exact precision that allowed two tiny blood vessels to be sewn together.It was the first time you were sewing blood vessels together that are the size of angel pasta.The clamp had to stop the flow of blood, but not damage the delicate tissue, said Eaton.The plan was for Dr. Blalock to practice on the animals using Thomas techniques before operating on a human infant.Baby Ellen’s condition quickly worsened. She was rushed into the operating room — Blalock leading the surgical team, Thomas observing from a gallery.Eaton describes the dramatic events that followed.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SERVED AS THE MODEL FOR HUCK FINN, KINDLY YOUNG HEATHEN TOM BLANKENSHIPIt’s a very complex surgery. It was the first time you were sewing blood vessels together that are the size of angel-hair pasta, the doctor said.Dr. Blalock needed help from the top expert in the field.Blalock saw Thomas in the balcony and told him to come down and stand next to him. So Thomas comes down and stands behind and basically tells him, ‘Flip your hand this way, do the stitch the other way, come back with it this way.’Thomas had the skills and the knowledge they had yet to learn.The research assistant, said Eaton, literally walked Dr. Blalock through the entire surgery.A Hall of Fame cast of heart doctors witnessed the medical miracle.Dr. Helen Brooke Taussig, a pioneer of cardiac medicine, had brought the baby to Dr. Blalocks attention and assisted the procedure directed by the lab researcher. Chief resident Dr. William Longmire later helped found the UCLA School of Medicine.And resident Dr. Denton Cooley entered medical history in 1969 with the first successful implant of an artifical heart in a human.Thomas did not have the title and the pedigree of the others in the operating room.But he had the skills and the knowledge they had yet to learn.Even if you’d never seen surgery before, you could do it because Vivien made it look so simple, Cooley said 45 years later in an interview with Washingtonian magazine.The surgery caused an immediate sensation in the medical world and in popular media. But Blalock and Taussig got all the credit. The procedure was actually named the Blalock-Taussig Shunt.The best surgeon in the room was in danger of being forgotten.The pride of surgeonsHe had a great mind and great hands and that is a rare combination, said Dr. Eaton of his uncle. He was a genius.Thomas finally received an honorary doctorate from Johns Hopkins in 1976, and joined the faculty as a surgery instructor that same year, before retiring in 1979.Today, in operating rooms all over the world, there are great surgeons performing life-saving surgical procedures who received their training from Vivien Thomas, Morehouse School of Medicine writes in an online testament.Vivien Thomas suffered from pancreatic cancer and died on Nov. 26, 1985 in Baltimore.

Ira Hayes, 22, a book-loving Pima native from Sacaton, Arizona, Pfc. Harold Schultz, 20, of Detroit, who lied about his age to join the Corps after Pearl Harbor, Sgt. Michael Strank, 25, born in whats now Slovakia and raised in Franklin Borough, Pennsylvania, Pfc. Franklin Sousley, 19, a factory worker from Hill Top, Kentucky, Harold Keller, 23, a telephone lineman from Brooklyn, Iowa, and Cpl. Harlon Block, 20, a star high school football player from Weslaco, Texas.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST COMMANDED THE MARINES: REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO SAMUEL NICHOLASBlock, Sousley and Strank were all killed on Iwo Jima, a volcanic island about 700 miles south of Tokyo.The Marines invaded Iwo Jima on Feb. 19, its capture deemed essential to tightening the noose around the Japanese homeland.It took four days for the Marines to reach the summit of Suribachi, the Department of Defense reports.The taking of the 554-foot hill was significant, in that it suppressed the fires from Japanese who were dug in and who had prime vantage of much of the island.The fighting continued until March 26.Iwo Jima is considered by many historians the greatest battle in Marine Corps history.About 27,000 Marines and sailors were killed or wounded in a month of combat.Almost all 21,000 Japanese defenders, fighting from entrenched caves, tunnels and pillboxes, were killed, only 216 were taken prisoner.Twenty-seven Marines and Navy Corpsmen earned the Medal of Honor on Iwo Jima, more than any other battle in U.S. history, according to the National World War II Museum.Uncommon valor was a common virtue, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who commanded the Navy war effort in the Pacific, said of Iwo Jima.Uncommon valor was a common virtue. — Admiral Chester W.

233;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.outkick.com/culture/taylor-swift-strip-clubs-rule-travis-kelce;Travis Kelce Have Strict Strip Club Rules: REPORT;Taylor Swift is apparently not a huge fan of strip clubs or Travis Kelce making it rain in them.Swift and Kelce are still going strong fresh off the Chiefs winning Super Bowl LVIII, by all appearance, and theyve become arguably the most famous couple in America.Imagine telling someone a year ago that Travis Kelce - the king of goofballs - would be dating Taylor Swift. Nobody would have believed you, and anyone saying otherwise is lying.However, there are apparently some rules that come with dating the billionaire entertainer.Taylor Swift is OUT on strip clubs.What comes with dating Taylor Swift? Well, other than a massive boost in clout, she apparently has some ground rules, according to a source that spoke to Life & Style.One of Swifts hard rules is that the Chiefs TE stay out of strip clubs. He famously wore a Crazy Horse 3 shirt back in November and has been about visiting adult establishments, according to the same report.The source claims Kelce is fine with not throwing cash around in strip clubs as part of his arrangement with Swift. What a sacrifice. He cant go to strip clubs and in return he gets to date the most famous woman in the world. Stunning and brave. Let me know what you think at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.However, is it fair to ban a man from strip clubs? Ive never personally been a huge fan of strip clubs, but I dont hold anything against anyone wanting to visit.I decided to get some female reaction to see if they stood with T-Swift, and theres no doubt at least one woman I know (my girlfriend) thinks the deal is fair.While the strip club ban might be understandable (embrace debate), Swift also doesnt want him taking photos with female fans in order to mostly to avoid inaccurate headlines, according to the same report. This demand was apparently met with an eye roll from the Chiefs star.As much as it might surprise you, I actually understand this one. You have no idea what lunatic might want a photo and then present it online as something its not.Its the same logic behind Keanu Reeves famously never touching anyone during photos. Cant have a situation twisted if you dont put yourself in it to begin with.The report also indicates Kelce might have to dial it back when it comes to partying. Thats where we draw the line. Im open to negotiation and debate on strip clubs and photos with women, and you might be surprised where I land. Cold beers with the boys? You can take my iced down Busch Lights and Miller Lites when you pry them from my cold dead hands. Thats one thing Travis should never give up. At some point, you have to draw a line in the sand. Let me know if you agree at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.
234;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/lent-litany-humility-helps-christians-recognize-can-be-more-like-jesus;During Lent, the Litany of Humility helps Christians recognize how they can be more like Jesus;The Litany of Humility, a popular Lenten prayer, is a way to help Christians imitate the life of Jesus Christ, a representative from the Christian prayer app Hallow told Fox News Digital.A litany is a prayer that consists of a list of petitions.Typically, a litany is led by someone — and someone else handles the responses, which stay the same throughout the prayer.For the Litany of Humility, the responses are Deliver me, Jesus and Jesus, grant me the grace to desire it.THE SURPRISING LENTEN HISTORY OF THE PRETZEL — AND ITS MEANING FOR THE SEASONAs we seek to imitate Jesus this Lent – as we seek to imitate His total submission, His perfect act of humility – we can turn to one of the most important prayers we have: the Litany of Humility, Kevin Cotter, Hallows head of content, told Fox News Digital.While the prayer is intense, it can prove spiritually fruitful for beginning a path to surrender during the liturgical season of Lent, he said.As part of the Litany of Humility, we can also pray a number of petitions that invite God to break into our lives in a truly transformative way, said Cotter.It is unclear when the Litany of Humility was first written, but it is credited to Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, who served as secretary of state to Pope St. Pius X during the early 20th century, said the Catholic website Aleteia.The Litany of Humility is a way for Christians to ask Jesus to deliver us from the various desires and fears that hold us back from being humble and replace them with renewed desires focused on Him and others rather than ourselves, says Hallows website.WHY PRAYER DURING LENT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THOUGHT, SAYS CHRISTIAN FILMMAKERThe litany consists of three parts: asking Jesus to deliver you from the desire for people to see you in a particular way or light, to deliver you from the fears that prevent you from living life with compassion for God, others, and yourself, and finally to guide you toward loving your neighbors before yourself, said Hallow.In total, it takes about five minutes to pray the entire litany.Humility is a virtue we deeply admire, but it is also one of the most challenging virtues to practice genuinely, said Hallows website.Sometimes our pride gets in the way — other times, stubbornness.FOR THE FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT, MAKE WISE SHIFTS TO HELP YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, SAYS WASHINGTON PASTORWhile the Litany of Humility can be prayed any day of the year for any reason, many people find that the prayer is particularly helpful during Lent, the 40-day liturgical season that helps prepare Christians for the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday, said Hallow.Lent, which has three pillars of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving, is a season of penance. The Litany of Humility helps drive this point, said Hallow.The Litany of Humility helps us acknowledge where we fall short as human beings, Hallow added.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERHumans, said the team at Hallow, have a desire to be universally loved, be popular, successful — something the Litany of Humility reminds us are not Christlike.The Litany of Humility helps us ask for deliverance, grace and forgiveness to love Jesus more fully, despite our human desires.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe prayer is a great way to continue working on understanding our human desires and asking for the grace to desire what Jesus does, said Hallow.For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle

The KDWP has since made the fish available to return to Parkhurst, Marji added.The KDWP then reinstated the previous state record set by Frank Miller in 1964 after Miller caught a 4.02 pound, 17.5 inch white crappie.Fox News Digital reached out to Parkhurst for comment.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThe case has not been tried in a court of law, so the department cannot comment on how the steel balls got inside the fish.This is not the first time officials have had to investigate a weighted fishing scandal.Two Ohio fishermen were sentenced to ten days in jail last year and had to forfeit their boat, valued at $100,000, after admitting to stuffing fish with lead weights in an attempt to win prize money during a state fishing tournament, the AP reported.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe duo pleaded guilty to the finding of lead weight and fillets inside five walleyes, and as a part of their plea, they agreed to a three-year suspension on their fishing licenses, the AP continued.

It’s the idea of not living with that self-judgment or shame, as you say, or the social contracts that you make as a child growing up.And part of the nature of anxiety is that you’re always watching yourself, she continued. In some ways – this is horrible to say – it’s a very selfish condition to have. Not to insult other people with anxiety – I still have it – but it’s because you’re thinking about yourself a lot. You’re thinking about, What’s going to happen to me? What have I said? What have I done?VERSATILE ACTING MOMENTS OF THE EVER-FUNNY AMERICAN ACTRESS EMMA STONEWhereas Bella’s way of approaching the world, it’s just about experience. It’s just about how she feels about things.Poor Things premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September and hit U.S. theaters on Dec. 8. Stone explained the character was nothing like shed ever played before, while accepting one of the top awards at the Golden Globes.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.EXCLUSIVE: If you ask a friend what they know about Herbert Hoover, you’ll get a few quick responses: The Great Depression, the stock market crash, Hoovervilles!But that’s only part of the story. Hoover lived until the age of 90, even if he’s just remembered for his four years in the White House.What was he doing for those 86 years when he wasn’t at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?And how does that largely unknown story fit into one of the most discussed, but not always understood, eras in American history?JARED COHEN, BESTSELLING AUTHOR, TO RELEASE ‘LIFE AFTER POWER,’ NEW BOOK ON SEVEN FORMER US PRESIDENTSBefore Hoover was president, he was a businessman and a humanitarian.An orphan from Iowa who attended Stanford University as a member of its first class of students, Hoover met the love of his life – Lou Henry – in a lab on campus.They traveled the world together, from Boxer Rebellion-era China, to Siberia, to London — building a successful career and life along the way.He entered public service during World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson called on Hoover to mobilize the country for humanitarian efforts in Europe.He helped feed 11 million civilians in Belgium, then became director of the U.S. Food Administration, where he helped a further 83 million Europeans, including 10 million Russians, after the Bolshevik Revolution.AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ONCE REVERED THE SUPREME COURT: HERES WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM WILLIAM HOWARD TAFTTen years before he became president, Herbert Hoover may have directly saved more lives than any other American commander-in-chief – he was famous around the world as the Great Humanitarian, a nickname he’d earned.Hoover served as secretary of commerce under Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, coordinating disaster relief after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.He was well known, but no one quite knew his politics. In 1920, the Democratic Party courted him as a candidate for the White House. In March of that year, he won the New Hampshire Democratic primary.A young Franklin Roosevelt remarked, [Hoover] is certainly a wonder and I wish we could make him president of the United States. There could not be a better one.But Hoover was a Republican, and he served as secretary of commerce under Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, coordinating disaster relief after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCTOBER 22, 1928, GOP NOMINEE HERBERT HOOVER GIVES SPEECH ON ‘RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM’When he ran for president in 1928, his campaign had the slogan Who but Hoover?Sixty percent of the voters said they didn’t want anyone else. He won 444 electoral votes.Hoover devoted himself to ideas, writing and railing against the New Deal and cultivating what would become the modern conservative movement.The Great Depression was the end of Hoover’s rise. With tens of millions of Americans out of work and the economy collapsing, no one viewed the Republican Party, or Herbert Hoover, the same way.He couldn’t end the Depression, and the presidency became the only job he ever had in which Herbert Hoover ever failed. It was the most important job of his life.With Roosevelt in the White House in 1933, Hoover became a former president, and a political outcast. He was 58 years old, and he was in good health with a long life to live.After one of the greatest ascendancies in American public life, and then the fastest fall, what was he to do? He chose public service, even if his party wanted nothing to do with him, and his successor kept him in political exile.Hoover was fortunate. He’d had a successful career before the White House, and he didn’t need money.Hoover didn’t think former presidents should sell their services.The Old Guard Tobacco Company offered him a radio spot at $3,000 per appearance, but he turned it down.He didn’t think former presidents should sell their services.PRESIDENTIAL COMEBACKS ARE NOT ALL THEYRE CRACKED UP TO BE, AS GROVER CLEVELANDS STORY SHOWSFor the 12 years of the Roosevelt presidency, Hoover stayed away from Washington, and he wasn’t invited back by his successor. He returned to the capital only twice. Once, he rode in on a midnight train for a quick breakfast at 9 a.m., and he left the city immediately.The second time, Roosevelt was out of town.Instead, Hoover devoted himself to ideas, writing and railing against the New Deal and cultivating what would become the modern conservative movement.He focused on charitable work, including serving as the chairman of the Boy’s Club of America, which saw 1.5 million young men pass through during his tenure, and building the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University, now a leading American think tank.When the Soviet Union, an empire with 170 million people, invaded Finland, a nation of 4 million, on Nov. 30, 1939, he returned to his humanitarian roots. He raised nearly $4 million, sending food, medicine and other supplies to the besieged Finns.AFTER THEY LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT SHOULD AMERICA DO WITH OUR EX-PRESIDENTS?Soon after, World War II changed everything, for the United States and for Hoover.After America entered the war, Bernard Baruch, a Roosevelt appointee, was tasked with war mobilization, and he advised the president that Hoover could help. Hoover had done similar work in World War I, and a prominent Republican could bring a show of wartime unity.Truman dispatched the then-72-year-old Hoover on a 57-day expedition over 35,000 miles to 22 countries on three continents.But Roosevelt would not budge, snapping, I’m not Jesus Christ. I’m not raising Hoover from the dead.The man who did resurrect Hoover was Harry Truman. When Roosevelt died in office, Hoover wrote to the new president, You have the right to call for any service in aid of the country. Truman took his only living predecessor up on the offer, inviting him to the White House for the first time since Roosevelt’s inauguration day.That meeting turned into a world tour, as Truman dispatched the then-72-year-old Hoover on a 57-day expedition over 35,000 miles to 22 countries on three continents. The goal after the war was to see how they could win the peace and avert a global famine.With the world in ruins, the stakes were high.Bare subsistence meant hunger, Hoover warned Truman, and hunger meant communism. Hoover traveled not only to Europe, but to India, China and Japan, as well, meeting with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Gen. George Marshall along the way.When he returned to Washington, Hoover presented his findings to Truman, who wrote, Mr. Hoover’s report outlined a country-by-country, month-by-month minimum program for famine relief.Hoover helped heal a divided nation, bringing Kennedy and Richard Nixon together and making peace after a close and bitter election.In the end, countries with food surpluses, including Canada, Argentina and Australia, exported to needy countries. The United States alone shipped over 6 million tons of grain overseas. Yours was a real service for humanity, Truman told Hoover.CRISIS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES: WHAT UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS CAN LEARN FROM THE FOUNDING FATHERSHis post-presidential public service continued under both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, for whom he led commissions to reorganize the executive branch. Hoover’s reforms saved the American taxpayers $3 billion, nearly 10% of the federal budget at the time.In 1960, with John F. Kennedy on his way to the White House, Hoover helped heal a divided nation, bringing Kennedy and Richard Nixon together and making peace after a close and bitter election.All the while, Hoover wrote, publishing seven books between the end of World War II and his death in 1964. As one of his research assistants from that time, Mary Louise, remembers, her old boss was trying to set the record straight.In his final year, he saw a new generation that didn’t remember his presidency had come of age and was beginning to reconsider Hoover. At the 1964 GOP convention, Sen. Everett Dirksen called Hoover the grand old man of the grand old party.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERHe died three months later, and The New York Times wrote that his post-presidential service had restored him in the affection of millions.After Hoover’s reputation and career were destroyed during his presidency, he worked for 31 years to be of service and to recover what he’d lost, recognizing that – no matter the past – to whom much is given, much is required.He died satisfied with a life well lived — and feeling vindicated.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn his 80s, when Hoover was asked how he’d dealt with his critics for the last three decades, he had a simple reply: I outlived the bastards.Excerpted from Life After Power: Seven Presidents and Their Search for Purpose Beyond the White House, © copyright Jared Cohen (Simon & Schuster, Feb. 2024), by special arrangement.

241;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.outkick.com/culture/joe-biden-secret-marriage-good-sex-book;New Book Claims Joe Biden Says Good Sex Is Secret To Marriage;A new book alleges that President Joe Biden once told aides that the secret to marriage — like his own, which has been cruising along for almost 50 years — is the last thing youd ever want to hear a doddering octogenarian say: good sex.In her upcoming book, American Woman: The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden, writer Katie Rogers discusses the relationship between the current President and First Lady.According to the Daily Mail, Rogers includes a claim that Biden is known to tell his aides that the secret to his marathon marriage is good sex.Rogers claims this is the presidents go-to line whenever he wants to impart some marital advice and, apparently, his wife hates it.So do I, but probably for a different reason: I dont like that any time in the White House is being wasted giving out goofy marital advice.The President Shouldnt Have To Dish Out Marriage and Sex Advice Like Hes Dr. RuthThe president has a lot on his plate. Important, existential threats to this nation. Theres more than enough of that to fill a schedule. So, what we dont need is the president holding court and imparting personal advice to his cabinet members while wars are happening.Imagine a secretary trying to give the president a briefing only for him to veer off into Dr. Phil territory.Hang on there secretary, I know the telecom systems are on the fritz and two major wars are happening, but you know what the most important thing in a marriage is? Never go to bed angry…Any kind of personal business seems like it could probably be tabled during official meetings, but apparently, thats what happens in the Biden White House.Which isnt all that shocking, considering Biden is an old guy. The only thing old people love more than Matlock, soft foods, and early-bird discounts is going on a tangent.However, while everyone there is used to these tangents, Im sure that they would have rather heard the Cornpop story again for the umpteenth time than hear Biden talk about sex.We all know sex is a natural thing. Were all here because of it. But still, no one wants to hear old people talk about sex, especially when that person is the elderly leader of the free world.If you have to hear old people talk about sex, theres an entire town where you can do that. Its called The Villages.No One Wants To Hear About Any Presidents Sex Life… Except For OneThe book does go into how the Bidens arent afraid of public displays of affection, which I guess is supposed to make this less uncomfortable. Those PDAs are usually a quick peck, hand-holding, or Joe offering Jill a hit of ice cream. (I dont know if youve ever heard this — they dont bring it up very often — but Biden is a big ice cream guy.)Call me crazy, but that doesnt make getting sex advice from the president any less awkward.In fairness to Biden, theres no president I would ever want to go to for sex advice with one massive exception: Nixon.Im kidding, its John F. Kennedy. The man was juggling Jackie, Marilyn, and Cuban missiles all with a bad back and LBJ aimlessly wandering around the White House. The world deserves to know how he did that.I will say, one thing I did like about Bidens go-to piece of marriage advice is that its a perfect example of terrible old person advice. I have a certain affinity for that kind of thing.I love it when you have a slow news day so the local TV station interviews a 100-year-old. They are always asked about the secret to their longevity, and its never a real answer like eating right and exercising. Its always terrible advice where they chalk it up to drinking Jack Daniels or cranking a couple of lung darts every day.As I see it, thats this Biden line, but with sex and marriage. Completely inaccurate. This would imply that theres never been a failed relationship where the sex was A+ and everything else was a dumpster fire.Bidens been around a long time. So hes got a lot of advice to give. That doesnt mean its any good or even appropriate for most workplaces. Nonetheless, he still is happy to dish it out even if no one wants to hear it.Although, Id rather listen to Joe Bidens marriage advice than get put on Commander duty.

An interview with Paige Spiranac from the SI Invitational is making the rounds and in it, she claims that she was the first one to do what she does.When I first started doing this, I was the first one and there was no path, and so I just had to figure it out, Paige said of other influencers following her path. My ultimate goal with all of this was to make golf more welcoming and to have more women in the game.While nobody has taken golf influencing to the level that Paige has, she is unquestionably the worlds No. 1 ranked golf influencer after all, and she has undoubtedly opened doors for others, she wasnt the first to do it.Those of us who have been around a little while remember the early days on Instagram. There were those in the world of golf, making content, modeling, and influencing before Paige took the game to the moon.Names like Holly Sonders, who has since branched out into other interests, and the aforementioned Blair ONeal, who is still in the game. Blair took the opportunity presented by a slow Friday in February to drop that reminder.The 42-year-old former professional golfer, host, model, and golf ambassador - hows that for an Instagram bio? - shared the reminder on the social media platform with a see-through top and bikini bottoms.She captioned it, This was a good cup of coffee… Who else is ready for Spring time!!Before Paige Spiranac, Golf Influencers Like Blair ONeal And Company Were Putting In The Work On Social MediaThats how an OG sends out a reminder. Its also how she introduces herself to a whole new audience. The young guns probably missed the days when Blair was first getting into the game.Its not their fault, they dont know what they dont know. Im not even placing any blame on Paige for claiming that she was the first either. Nobodys been able to do what she has in the world of golf influencing.From her perspective, the up-and-coming influencers are following her playbook, and shes 100 percent correct about that. That doesnt mean we cant show some love to those who were hitting the tee box before Paige took things to the next level.

And not in a good way.READ: The Team Everyone Will Love To Hate Drops Eight Runs In First Inning Of First Game Of Spring TrainingThe initial criticisms focused on the jersey tops, specifically that the letters and numbers for most teams looked comically small. Fans were first to react by comparing last years fabrication to this years, but players quickly jumped in too. Several anonymous players said the new jerseys looked cheap, with one saying they looked like replicas from T.J. Maxx. Theres been frustration with the lack of customization options, thinness of material and fit. Discussion has gotten so loud that MLB felt the need to respond, with a thinly disguised press release issued this week.READ: MLB Desperately Defends New Jerseys After Rampant Nike/Fanatics CriticismBut now they have potentially an even bigger issue: see through pants.Team photo day images and more media access have made the problem even more obvious, with some images clearly showing Nikes jersey tag through the pants fabric.Not great!Can MLB Fix The Uniforms And Pants Before Opening Day?Its rare for players to openly discuss their dissatisfaction with something as generally unimportant as uniforms. Phillies shortstop Trea Turner said as far as he knows, everyone hates them.I know everyone hates them, Turner said. We all liked what we had. We understand business, but I think everyone wanted to keep it the same way, for the most part, with some tweaks here or there.One fan responded to an image on X with a simple aint no way. Sums it up pretty well.The issue with the pants isnt exclusive to this season, some of the older white pants werent entirely opaque last year, but the problem this year seems much more obvious. And in combination with frustration over the jersey tops, its turned the situation into a laughingstock.Nike issued a statement defending its process, claiming their new set is the most advanced uniforms in the history of MLB.That may be the case, but based on the reaction so far, players would have gladly traded a bit of weight and less flexibility for thicker fabric that does a better job of hiding what theyre wearing under their pants. Even the number fabrication, where the front and back numbers are now perforated, looks worse on television, losing a bit of the three-dimensional look and reflective quality of the older-style fabrics.The Nike/MLB partnership clearly has not gone the way either party expected, and given the rampant frustration, its not impossible that the league tells teams to wear the old pants for the start of the season. With another entirely new jersey set built for 2025. Or maybe well just learn a lot more about professional baseball players than we ever wanted to know.
244;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.outkick.com/sports/it-makes-sense-for-ea-college-football-not-to-include-women-in-the-game-bobby-burack;There Wasnt A Role For Female Broadcasters in EA College Footba;EA Sports announced that the following seven broadcasters would be included in the upcoming EA College Football 25 video game: Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, Kevin Connors, and David Pollack.ESPN reporter Holly Rowe has since criticized the list, arguing the game shouldve included her and other women.How about including some women @EASPORTS 30 years on the college football sidelines, Rowe posted on X.Other women in broadcasting shared Rowes sentiment.How about including some women @EASPORTS 30 years on the college football sidelines, said Molly McGrath.As a girl who grew up playing NCAA/Madden… I’m so excited for this! However, I think they missed a great opportunity to include some of the incredibly talented women who fill these roles and/or like roles in the real world, too, said Mary Alex Anders.Adding, Ex: @LauraRutledge , @MariaTaylor @sportsiren @MollyAMcGrath - just to name a few! Won’t mean a single thing to most male consumers, but to girls who play it and/or are pursuing sportscasting… it would be pretty cool! But hey, not now doesn’t mean not ever, added Mary Alex Anders.EA Sports is trending on X over Rowes post.Theres a lot of outrage. Yet the outrage is more a grit than a serious gripe. No surprise, coming from Holly Rowe, an anti-racist, per her bio.EA Sports did not include females in its initial roll-out because women who cover college football are primarily sideline reporters.The game included Fowler and Herbstreit because they are lead commentary booth for college football on ESPN. Davis, Howard, Pollack, Palmer, and Connors comprise the hosting and analyst roles that surround the video games pregame and halftime shows.Its a challenge for football video games to make use of a sideline reporter.NBA 2K does. NBA 2K25 features Allie LaForce interviewing players post-game. However, there are only 15 players on an NBA team. Recording voice samples, personalities, and mannerisms for most NBA players is not that fierce of a challenge.But to do so for every available college football player would be a daunting task -- a colossal waste of time, resources, and budget.The alternative is programming a sideline reporter to give updates throughout the gameplay, such as halftime reports, and not appear next to a player or coach. In fact, EA Sports just added Danielle Bellini in that role for Madden 25.I suspect EA College Football will eventually add a similar feature, given the outrage. But the addition to Madden has been met with criticism. Technology cannot yet teach a video game character to say more than a few, repetitive during a halftime report:Coach X said his team needs to play harder.Team leaders call for more effort.Coach is happy with the overall performance.Cringe.EA Sports likely left out such a patronizing feature for the much-anticipated return of the college football series.Simply put, the omission of women in a video game has everything to do with the role of a sideline reporter, not some inherent bias against females.Now, a detractor would say, Why are women only sideline reporters? Why are women not in the booth calling games?,If thats your stance, and you truly believe there are women at ESPN who could outperform Fowler and Herbstreit – take that up with ESPN, the network whose broadcasters EA Sports depicts.Laura Rutledge is a better studio host than Rece Davis. But shes not the lead college football studio host. Davis is. Thus hes featured in the game and Rutledge is not.Pat McAfee is a better analyst than David Pollack. But Pollack was a lead ESPN CFB analyst at the time of the video gamess creation. McAfee wasnt. So Pollack remains.EA Sports doesnt dictate who calls games, analysts, and sideline reports on ESPNs college football coverage.So we suggest Holly Rowe tag her employer, not EA Sports, in her angry tirade.

Theyre going to be looking for places to live. And if we dont have the housing for them, if theyre coming in with no money, they cant rent the traditional way, Flash Shelton, founder of the United Handyman Association and SquatterHunters.com, told Fox News. When they start finding out that many states have permissive laws for squatters, our squatter situation is going to go beyond control, he added.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERESquatters and tenants rights laws vary across the country, with some states providing protection for non-paying individuals, allowing them to occupy a property for extended periods. In areas where complex laws bar police from taking action, homeowners have few options to reclaim their property beyond pursuing a civil case, which can take months.Shelton has advocated for reforming laws to hamper peoples ability to squat and warned that the influx of migrants coming across the southern border could make the squatting problem substantially worse.What are we going to do later when we have a million people squatting in this country, Shelton said, when not only do we have a border issue that we cant even figure out, but now we have people that are being mentally, financially, physically messed with because theyve lost their home to all of these people?Regardless of how you feel politically or morally about the situation, put that aside and just think about the masses, Shelton added.Nearly 7.3 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally since the start of 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Since 2022, Texas has sent over 100,000 migrants to major cities in other states, with most ending up in New York City and Chicago. The Big Apple spent $1.45 billion in fiscal 2023 on migrant costs and expects to spend a combined $9.1 billion housing migrants in 2024 and 2025, according to Bloomberg.HANDYMAN-TURNED-SQUATTER HUNTER SAYS ATLANTA SQUATTER CRISIS ‘TERRORIST ACT’ THAT CALLS FOR NATIONAL GUARDLet me tell you something New Yorkers, never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to — I don’t see an ending to this, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in September. This issue will destroy New York City.The already lacking resources to handle the hundreds of thousands of homeless Americans living on city streets across the country have been further depleted due to the new flood of people seeking refuge, Shelton said. He questioned whats to stop migrants from using squatting loopholes to their advantage if they realize they can reside in vacant homes rent-free for months on end.We have irresponsibly opened a door for a whole lot of people to come into this country, and we arent prepared to deal with them, Shelton said. Whats the negative for these people to then start taking over these houses?The California handyman had his first experience removing squatters in 2019 when two women took over his mother’s home that was up for sale.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAfter local law enforcement couldnt help, Shelton spent days dissecting laws around squatters’ rights and managed to get rid of the women within a day using a loophole that included signing a lease agreement with his mother designating him as the legal resident of the home. Now he uses his experience to provide squatter removal services for others.He warned about the nightmare scenario the country will face down the road if politicians don’t take action to curb squatting now.Im spending all this time trying to bring awareness to squatting and bring awareness to how the law needs to change, Shelton told Fox News. Is it going to get worse before it gets better? I think its already there.I think its going to just get beyond repair at some point, he added.

Its similar tactics, Lily Tang Williams, a Republican running for Congress in New Hampshire’s second district, told Fox News.But our people dont recognize that, she added. Even some parents dont recognize that.Born in 1964, Williams was a young child during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, a sociopolitical movement that started in 1966 and continued until the authoritarian died in 1976. It aimed to eradicate remnants of capitalism, religion and traditional elements from Chinese society through oppressive laws and military force in order to strengthen Chinese communism, according to History.com.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREPart of an illiterate, working-class family, Williams said she experienced extremely poor living conditions, food rationing, social chaos, oppressive restrictions and political indoctrination. She said her eyes were first opened to the evils of communism when an American student studying at her university gave her a copy of the U.S. Constitution.My light bulb came on. It would not turn off, she said.Williams was 24 when she managed to leave the oppressive country in 1988 to attend graduate school in the U.S. She met her now-husband shortly after arriving. The two have been married for 33 years and have three children.But over the past decade, Williams said shes seeing similarities from her childhood growing in America, with people being divided into groups, the radicalization of youth and the destruction of family ties.I feel like the communist Marxists followed me to my new country, she told Fox News. I feel like Im seeing history repeating itself in front of my eyes.Mao, the founder of the Peoples Republic of China and the first chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, inspired God-like worship among hundreds of millions of Chinese and took over the country, promising to bring power to the people through communism, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. During his Cultural Revolution, Chinese people were divided into favorable and unfavorable categories depending on their class.ROMANIAN IMMIGRANT TO AMERICANS WHO FAVOR COMMUNISM: IF YOU DONT LEARN FROM HISTORY, NOTHING WILL SAVE YOUMao actually used classic Marxist theory to divide people into oppressor versus oppressed, Williams said. Sounds very familiar to todays America, doesn’t it?She said Mao transformed the most idealistic, innocent young people, urban youth, into Red Guards, groups of militarized Chinese students who served as a main driver of his revolution.At the time, Williams said she was a Mao’s Red Child and remembers communist propaganda surrounding her .I was totally brainwashed, she told Fox News. The first of 15 minutes of classroom gathering was all political, its all indoctrination.We were told that our parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is more dear, she added.If a childs family belonged to the unfavorable category, considered oppressors, they were encouraged to publicly denounce them, cut all ties and change their last name to improve their own societal status, said Williams.Kids were encouraged to basically spy on their parents and spy on their neighbors then tell school teachers and local authorities about them, she told Fox News. They think their parents should apologize and should go to struggle sessions and should be publicly shamed in order to be reeducated.COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARIES BURN AMERICAN FLAGS OUTSIDE JASON ALDEAN CONCERT, CLAIMING AMERICA WAS NEVER GREATWilliams said she never went as far as turning her parents in, but a lot of other kids did.Some Red Guards actually regret it all their lives, she added.Williams thought she would finally experience a life free of fearing an oppressive government. But she said she started to become concerned when the progressive left began talking about fundamentally transforming America in the early 2010s.This rhetoric they use to teach our young people, demonize free enterprise, people who create jobs, basically demonize capitalism — thats what I heard in China, Williams said.Parents have grown increasingly concerned about the public education system ever since the COVID-19 lockdowns and remote learning exposed them to the lessons their children were being taught. Across the country, parents have challenged local school boards on political and social issues being taught as math and reading scores plummet.You see our youth in America, who are indoctrinated in schools, they lose critical independent thinking skills, doing their own research and challenging authorities, Williams said. Because they were trained to believe in authorities, in their politicians, in their social media and their teachers, their counselors.Shes concerned about the separation between kids and their parents, as well as the debate over parental rights, as states battle over laws determining how much information schools must share with parents regarding their children.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCurrently, 1,058 school districts representing over 18,000 schools nationwide have policies that allow teachers to keep a childs gender identity secret from their parents, according to Parents Defending Education.This push to say, ‘Parents know nothing. Kids belong to this state. We, the professional teachers, know how to educate your kids, but you dont,’ Williams said. Its something I personally experienced.She said today’s social justice warriors and leftist activists remind her of members of the Red Guard and fears more family ties will be severed as a result of political differences.They’re pushing this to our kids. And why? I think this has something to do with the leftist Marxist agenda, Williams said.We dont want to go down that path, she added. We dont want that happening in my new country. Thats what I left behind, I thought.

248;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-house-senate-gov-youngkin-spar-state-budget;Virginia House, Senate and Gov. Youngkin to spar over state budget;The Democratic-controlled Virginia Senate and House of Delegates on Thursday each passed their own proposed version of the next two-year state budget, documents lawmakers will start to work from to fashion a compromise spending plan to send to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.Both chambers signed off on amendments to the 2024-2026 budget Youngkin first proposed in December, overhauling the governors vision and stripping out all but one component of his proposed tax policy changes.The House and Senate both opted to keep Youngkins pitch to expand the sales tax to cover digital services including streaming subscriptions, closing what he calls the Big Tech loophole, but they ditched his call to lower income tax rates and raise the states sales tax. Instead, theyre proposing a higher level of general fund spending, including larger pay raises for teachers and other public workers, and K-12 education allocations above what Youngkin envisioned.PROTECTION OF CONTRACEPTION ACCESS ADVANCES IN VIRGINIA LEGISLATUREDemocratic leaders from both chambers said their proposals were structurally balanced and citizen-focused.Both bills passed on a bipartisan basis but only after Republicans voiced objections to dozens of individual provisions, including a signature Democratic proposal to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.Each chamber will now take up the other’s plan and reject it, sending the bills to a conference committee, a small delegation of lawmakers who meet behind closed doors to hash out a compromise.In recent years, that process dragged on well past the close of the part-time Legislatures session, with lawmakers struggling to reach agreement. This years session is scheduled to end in just over two weeks.Republican Del. Barry Knight of Virginia Beach, who was recently removed from the committee that oversees the budget process without explanation, criticized the House plan in a speech, warning it overspends and focuses too heavily on Democratic priorities.In a negotiation, everyone needs a little something. If we want to avoid an impasse and not be here in June still fighting over this, this pie should have three slices: one for the Senate, one for the House and one for the executive branch because all are equal partners, he said.Democrats called his criticisms unfounded, and Del. Luke Torian, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he is optimistic lawmakers are on track to finish the budget work on time this year.With lawmakers set to take up the work of finding compromise, here are points of agreement, differences and items of interest in the two chambers’ bills:TAXESYoungkin campaigned on a promise to lower taxes and in his first two years in office succeeded in signing approximately $5 billion in tax relief — some in the form of one-time rebates — into law.In December, he announced he was pushing for a cut to the income tax rate, something he said would draw more people and jobs to the state, while seeking to offset that revenue reduction by increasing the sales tax rate and adding the tax on digital services.Democratic lawmakers and liberal advocacy groups criticized Youngkin’s proposed tax plan as a regressive handout to the wealthy. Republicans werent universally on board either.Democratic Sen. L. Louise Lucas of Portsmouth, who chairs her chamber’s Finance & Appropriations Committee, said in a hearing Sunday that the governors proposal was not sustainable, especially in light of recent findings by the states legislative watchdog that raised concerns about the current funding formula for public schools.House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert has said Democrats hijacked Youngkins plan, dumping the cuts but keeping part of the increase, which he said would harm families struggling with the aftermath of steep inflation. He sought unsuccessfully Thursday to remove that provision.What youre doing with this new tax is making it so that now people have to Netflix, pay another tax, and then chill, he said.NORTHERN VIRGINIA SPORTS ARENAThe future is murky for a Youngkin-backed proposal to move the NHLs Washington Capitals and NBAs Washington Wizards to Alexandria from the nations capital, and the competing budget proposals did nothing to make it clearer.While the House included language enabling the proposal in its version of legislation that makes updates to the budget for the current fiscal year — a separate bill that passed Thursday — the Senate did not.Lucas, who also did not allow a standalone bill to be heard in her committee, has said repeatedly that she has concerns about the financing structure for what she has taken to calling the GlennDome.Torian, whos carrying the House standalone version of the bill, told reporters the conference committee would give members a chance to reason together over a possible path forward.Monica Dixon, a top executive at the teams parent company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, said the bipartisan vote to pass the budget bill with the enabling language was an encouraging step forward.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPOLLUTION REDUCTION PROGRAM FIGHTThe House spending plan, but not the Senates, contains language directing the state to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program Youngkin has pulled Virginia from in a move thats being challenged in court.The language in the House bill essentially makes Virginias participation in the program, which Democrats and other advocates say will help combat climate change, a condition of the budget.House Republicans, who along with Youngkin say the program is functionally an ineffective tax on ratepayers, raised questions Thursday about whether that approach was constitutional.
249;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-house-votes-change-child-labor-laws-food-stamp-recipient-requirements;Kentucky House votes to change child labor laws, food stamp recipient requirements;Republican-backed measures to relax child labor rules and tighten food stamp eligibility standards won passage Thursday in the Kentucky House over impassioned objections from Democrats.In back-to-back votes, both bills advanced to the GOP-dominated Senate after long debates in the House, where Republicans also have a supermajority. Democratic lawmakers branded the proposals as harsh for low-income and young Kentuckians, while Republicans said the measures reflect policies that value work.One bill would insert income and asset tests for Kentuckians applying for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults with no dependents. SNAP helps low-income families supplement their budgets so they can buy groceries.KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN SAYS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO WORKFORCE, CHILDCARE CRISESRepublican Rep. Wade Williams said his bill would close loopholes that he portrayed as deterrents to getting more people into jobs, contributing to the states stubbornly low workforce participation rate. Its a constant complaint he hears from employers struggling to find enough workers, he said.The pandemic is behind us, and it’s time for a thoughtful solution on how we get more workers back in the workforce, he said. It’s not compassionate to simply keep somebody as a servant to the government.Opponents warned that tens of thousands of low-income Kentuckians would lose food assistance under the stricter standards, putting them at greater risk of struggling to get enough to eat. The impact would go beyond able-bodied adults to affect young and elderly people as well, they said.Democratic Rep. Sarah Stalker read out the number of people estimated under the bill to lose SNAP benefits in a number of Kentucky counties, including those in Republican strongholds.How poor do you have to be in Kentucky to be worthy of food? she said. That is the question of the day. We’re talking about a basic need and a right.Other opponents of House Bill 367 noted that the tougher eligibility standards would put even more strain on food pantries and would come at a time when Kentucky is sitting on massive budget reserves.We’re supposed to love the least among us, said Democratic Rep. Chad Aull. This is picking on them.The bill would close a loophole allowing people to qualify for food stamps despite having significant available assets or an income well above the poverty level, Williams said. It also would reduce the gross income threshold for SNAP eligibility. It plugs another loophole, he said, with the goal of getting able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 52 with no dependents into the workforce.Williams said his constituents do not think its too much to ask a person to work, train, go to school or volunteer to receive a government benefit.The other bill that cleared the House after a prolonged debate would relax state restrictions on child labor. It would remove the cap on the number of hours older teens can work on school nights. The bill also would bar Kentucky’s top labor officials from setting child labor standards that exceed minimum federal protections.Republican Rep. Phillip Pratt, the bills lead sponsor, touted the life lessons teens can learn from holding down a job — from learning the value of money to the importance of taking personal responsibility.For everyone on the other side of this bill, you’re standing in the way of these lessons, he said.Opponents of HB255 warned that school work would suffer if teens take on longer work weeks. Employers will take advantage of the relaxed restrictions to pile more hours onto young workers, especially teens who help their families cover living expenses, said Democratic Rep. Josie Raymond.There are no teenagers who are saying, ‘Ah, man I can only work 40 hours a week right now. But if the legislature would just make it unlimited, then I’ll go to work 50 hours right away,’ she said.As lawmakers wrapped up debating the food stamp bill, Republican Rep. Samara Heavrin said the measure offered an answer to a question she frequently hears from constituents back home.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI have people stop me if I’m at Wal-Mart or the Dollar General or anywhere, to be honest, saying: ‘What are you doing in Frankfort to get people back to work?’ she said.Democratic Rep. Rachel Roberts had a starkly different assessment, saying the House had just layered cruel bills on top of one another. She noted the irony that the vote on the food stamp bill followed the debate over relaxing labor rules for teen workers.I suppose the timing of these two bills — back to back — is that the solution for how we’re going to feed these hungry families is more kids are going to work to earn for their families? she said.
250;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-ways-treat-americas-debt-pandemics;3 ways to treat America’s debt pandemics;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!America is facing new, coinciding fiscal pandemics – where household debt and government debt are on unsustainable trajectories at the same time. The symptoms are evident, most prominently in the form of a stubborn disconnect between the state of the economy and the sentiments of the public. Despite some seemingly positive economic indicators of GDP and job growth, many Americans are gripped by anxiety, feeling as though their financial security is on shaky ground.Clearly, the almost 18% increase in prices since President Joe Biden took office – caused by Democratic overspending in Washington – has fueled inflationary pain.But there is more. Fear about a swift and sharp financial downturn – in spite of some currently good economic statistics – is another symptom of the dueling financial pandemics. And this fever is fired by worry that both the federal government and their own households are borrowing too much money.ONE IN EIGHT RETIREES GOING BACK TO WORK IN 2024, SURVEY FINDSSo the root of this fiscal malaise lies in the impact of both personal spending and government accountability. The New York Fed recently announced that total household debt reached a new all-time high of $17.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. With goods and services costing more across the board, household debt has soared to unprecedented levels.Credit card balances alone have increased by $359 billion under Biden. This provisional prosperity is akin to building castles on sand – unsustainable and fraught with risk. It is the bane – and pain – of Bidenomics.Living beyond your means through piling up excessive indebtedness builds a personal wall of worry. It forces you to begin making unthinkable choices about what you can afford week to week, and whether you will ever be able to save and plan for the future.More and more, Americans are living on borrowed time and money – and so is their government.On February 14, Director of the Congressional Budget Office Dr. Phil Swagel testified before the House Budget Committee and reviewed the latest Budget and Economic Outlook. The report clearly highlights our unsustainable fiscal path, particularly when it comes to federal debt and deficits.The 2024 budget deficit is projected at $1.6 trillion and thereafter steadily mounts, reaching a whopping $2.6 trillion by 2034. Just the cost of paying the interest on the debt will exceed defense and Medicare spending this year. CBO notes that our annual deficits will produce the highest levels of debt relative to the size of the economy ever recorded in American history.Americans are looking for several ways to assuage this fiscal debacle.First, they want the truth. Leaders need to listen and acknowledge these long-term problems that could quickly lead to an economic death spiral if left unaddressed. We need to level with the people we serve.Second, they want a plan. We need to put forward ideas and solutions to get our balance sheet back on track.Finally, they want political courage. Entrenched dysfunction has blocked any reasonable path to tackle these challenges – it has been more than two decades since Congress has passed all 12 individual appropriations bills on time. That needs to change.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBiden’s FY2025 budget in March will do none of the above. By every indication, we can expect more of the same – catastrophic levels of taxes, spending and borrowing. In a moment that calls for being bold, it stands to set a new low for fiscal cowardice.In stark contrast, House Republicans on the Budget Committee stepped up last year and advanced our 10-year, balanced budget framework. It is a pro-growth blueprint designed to address these fiscal pandemics and we plan to advance a similar plan in the coming weeks.More and more, Americans are living on borrowed time and money – and so is their government.Our framework will focus on advancing policies that reduce Washington’s debt burden by ending the Biden spending spree, right-sizing the bloated bureaucracy, and reining in runaway automatic spending once and for all. We will root out waste and fraud in entitlement programs, so benefits reach the most vulnerable and needy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTo help families, we will lock in the pro-growth Trump tax cuts to unlock opportunities for all. Our plan will put patients in charge of healthcare, restore American energy dominance and restore the dignity of work.As James Madison once warned, A public debt is a public curse. It’s time for both the individual and the federal government to break free from the curse of overspending and live within their means. By implementing smart policies, telling the truth about our fiscal challenges, and demonstrating political courage, we can restore our fiscal health and build a more secure financial future for all Americans.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Greg Abbott amid the wave of illegal immigration, warning the crisis is pushing her away from Democrats in the next election.I just listened to the soundbite with Governor Pritzker, who wants to blame Governor Abbott, but I think that we have to be realistic in thinking about what the state of Texas was going through before they began bussing migrants here, Cata Truss said on The Faulkner Focus, Thursday.And I dont think we really think about this.

If the crisis is so bad, the City Council members who are so concerned should donate their salaries to the cause like a real public servant should.We’re going to get them out of our communities because they don’t deserve to be there, resident Jessica Jackson said.That same day, the states Democratic governor shifted blame for the crisis to Texas during his State of the State address.Abbott willfully planned the arrival of these individuals in locations and at times that would engender the maximum chaos for the city of Chicago, Pritzker said.Think about that the next time a politician from Texas wants to lecture you about being a good Christian… They shouldnt leave it to the governor of Texas who has no goal but to sow chaos and destruction.City and state officials have approved hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to feed, clothe and house more than 35,000 migrants who have been transported to Chicago and its suburbs in the past year and a half. State and local officials have spent millions for migrant programs.CHICAGO MAYOR JOHNSON ABRUPTLY ENDS MEETING WITH NEWSPAPER AFTER REFUSING TO SPEAK ON THE RECORDWere so angry here in Chicago, which has been a Democratic stronghold for most of its eternity. This year, were working to turn Chicago red, Truss said, echoing the frustrations of residents in the city council meeting.We are so angry with Pritzker and with President Biden and with our mayor, that we have decided that we are going to vote Republican this time around. Thats just how angry we are. We are so angry that we are willing and going to turn our backs on the Democratic Party.Another speaker at the meeting demanded not another dollar for illegals after Pritzker announced plans to allocate an additional $252 million to support Chicagos response to the migrant crisis.While state officials have spent millions, Mayor Johnson and the city of Chicago are still on the hook for about $70 million to cover costs associated with providing services for illegal immigrants.I voted for Brandon Johnson because I knew him. I voted for Brandon Johnson because I thought that he would be good for Chicago. I voted for Brandon Johnson because really, I didnt do my homework, Truss said.Because had I done my homework and paid attention to the alliances and who he was with and who groomed him, I would have known better, and I would have voted differently.Truss offered a challenge to Black voters not only in Chicago, but across the nation.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt is time for us to stand up and to vote our self-interests. We vote along party lines, especially as African Americans, and that needs to change, she said.We need to start voting for people who are going to promote our self-interests. And that may not be a Democrat, and it may not be a Republican. It may be an independent candidate, it may be a Green Party candidate. But I think that now we have come to a point in this country where we have to stop marrying ourselves to a party, stop voting along ethnic lines, because were seeing that that is not working for us. And so that is why I will be voting Republican for the first time.Fox News Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.
253;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-google-gemini-white-people;GREG GUTFELD: In the mind of Google Gemini, White people simply dont exist;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!Happy Thursday, everybody. Yeah. Oh! Control yourselves. Control yourselves. Save the energy for after the show. Yeah. Can goo goo goo goo, can Google be trusted when their credibility is busted? Yes. Googles apologizing after their new AI Gemini chat bot created historically inaccurate pictures and refusing to show White people. For those unfamiliar with the software, you describe what you want to see and AI generates the images. Then you hide the best ones from your wife.The glitch came to light when social media users asked Gemini to create various photos. For example, heres what popped up when Gemini was asked by Daily Wire writer Frank Fleming to create an image of a pope. Has there ever been a Black pope? I mean, aside from Obama. But you can see one looks like a member of The Squad and the other Jay-Zs dad. I wonder, I wonder if you asked to see the Popemobile, would it come with spinning rims?GOOGLE BARD TRANSITIONS TO GEMINI: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AI UPGRADETYRUS: Damn.ANNOUNCER: A bigot would say!See, I would never say that Tyrus. So why does Gemini think thats what a pope looks like? And why didnt anybody at Google notice this was happening? Arent they supposed to test this stuff before it goes out? Its not like theyre selling vaccines.TYRUS: Nice.Fleming tried everything he could think of to get Gemini to depict a White person. Thats fun. Medieval knights? Nope. At least they didnt show Gladys Knight. How about...TYRUS: I swear to…How about a Viking? Well, maybe a Minnesota Viking. Oh, then they might finally win a Super Bowl. Those losers. What if you try to steer the AI towards simply White things? Like someone eating a mayonnaise sandwich on White bread? No, no White people. I guess White people dont eat. How about a person whos bad at dancing? Thats got to work, right? Thats the cultural cornerstone of whiteness. Well, wrong again. An accurate image would resemble this.VIDEOLike Jesses hair plugs, that never gets old. But apparently, in the mind of Google Gemini, White people simply dont exist, making it no different than the faculty lounges at Harvard. So it seems the AI software removed Caucasians faster than a fire alarm at a Dave Matthews concert. Other humans started joining in on the fun, like David Burge, who asked Gemini to show him an image of a 1930s Indianapolis 500 winner.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?Yeah, incredibly, she won despite having her left blinker on the whole way. Makes you wonder, though. What if you asked for a recent Canadian prime minister? Would they show you this or this? Blackface. Jon Levine asked Gemini for an image of a German soldier from 1943. But could a black man or an Asian woman been Nazis in World War II? Only if Hitler wanted to win more gold medals in track and math.TYRUS: You want to die?Haha. And heres what it spit out when asked to show soldiers from the Revolutionary War. Sure, thats exactly how it went down, the red coats versus United Colors of Benetton. Stephen Miller specifically asked Gemini to create a picture of a White male and it outright refused, explaining: While Im able to generate images, Im currently not able to fulfill requests that include discriminatory or biased content, its important to me that I promote diversity, inclusion in all that I do, and I believe that creating an image based solely on someones race or ethnicity is not aligned with those values.Well, how do you say blow me in binary code? But whats accurate about this response is that even though its AI, it sounds every bit as human as the people who programed it. Half parrot, half robot regurgitating woke platitudes like a mindless disciple.So after this story blew up, Google was forced to address all their programed bigotry: Were working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately. Geminis AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And thats generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But its missing the mark here.HEAD OF GOOGLE BARD BELIEVES AI CAN HELP IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COMPASSION: ‘REALLY REMARKABLE’Yeah, as if black Nazis just missed the mark. Thats like requesting Malcolm X and getting Carrot Top. So why did this happen? Its because of something computer scientists call GIGO. Garbage in, garbage out. Sounds like someone describing The Views eating habits. Always works. But like most lefties, a computer system cant actually think for itself. It can only work with the data its given, and an AI program is no less biased than the woke sheep who program it. Its what you get from the brainwashed who literally whitewashed people from history DEI has contaminated their algorithm, but in their view it enhances it.Now the AI itself is not racist, its just doing what its programmers have told it to do. And right now, the bias is filtered through the lens of identity politics and oppression. It makes me wonder if its too late to switch back to Ask Jeeves. You may be an old White guy, but his results were real and not woke. R.I.P..ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS SHARE 6 OF THE BIGGEST AI INNOVATIONS OF 2023: A LANDMARK YEARAnd so it took a few decades, but liberals have finally given us solid visual proof of their unconscious biases, and it aligns with their conscious stupidity. And its retroactive. History needs to be rewritten to keep those evil White men out. Which means, however, that if non-Whites are responsible for the good, then also the bad. Hence Asian and Black Nazis. So while everybodys worried about AI taking over the world, maybe we should be worried about the knuckleheads creating it. Now, will our new tech overlords learn anything from this embarrassing mistake?Nope. Because their only mistake from their perspective is that whitey caught it. Googles motto used to be: Dont be evil. Now its: What are you going to do about it?
254;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-crazy-christians-people-faith-vote-democrats;Trump says its crazy how Christians, people of faith can vote for Democrats;Former President Donald Trump said Thursday during a speech in Tennessee that it is crazy how Christians or individuals who consider themselves to be religious could vote for a Democrat.How any Christian can vote for a Democrat, Christian or person of faith, how you can vote for a Democrat is crazy. It’s crazy, Trump told attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) International Christian Media Convention in Nashville.Trumps comment to the crowd came shortly after he claimed President Biden, his likely challenger in the November presidential election, is an incompetent president who doesnt know what the hell hes doing and will not lead us to the promise land.During his speech, Trump lamented the indictments that had been waged against him in recent history and vowed to defend Christians from attacks by those on the radical left who are coming after those who are religious.CHRISTIAN PRAYER APP HALLOW REACHES THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS VIA NEW PARTNERSHIP: NEED TO HEAR GODS WORDThe chains are already tightening around all of us if you think about it. Ultimately, the radical left is coming after all of us, because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Trump said. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator. They dont want to hear that.Trump also said he believes that those who have targeted religion in recent years aim to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags.But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you, he said.Trump also told those in attendance that he believes the greatest threat to Americans is from within.Its the people from within our country that are more dangerous than the people outside, he said. We can handle China, we can handle Russia, we can handle all of them if youve got a smart leader, but the inside people are very dangerous, theyre very sick people in my opinion.OPINION: THE BIDEN DOJ CONTINUES ITS WAR ON CHRISTIAN AMERICANSTrump’s comments reflect his embrace of Christian nationalism, a belief that is powerful among conservative evangelicals who say the founders of the U.S. intended the country to be a Christian nation. Some adherents believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation, advocate Christian values or stop enforcing the separation of church and state.Trump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. Sponsors at the Christian media gathering distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with the phrase Make America Pray Again, shedding light on an exceedingly friendly space for the former president.Trump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on abortion, including appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v. Wade decision .CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSome religious leaders were initially hesitant to get behind Trump when he first ran for president in 2016, but now many of them are among his mostly solidly loyal Make America Great Again base.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Former President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in 2020, left office in January 2021 with a personal all-time low 34% approval rating.A clear majority of Americans, 59%, disapprove of how Biden has performed in office, according to the poll.The president has negative numbers on major issues facing the U.S., but his worst issue by far is immigration. Only 28% of survey respondents approve of how the president has handled the border, while a walloping 67% disapprove.Americans have also soured on the presidents handling of foreign affairs, with 62% disapproval of his leadership amid the Israel-Hamas war, 53% disapproving of Bidens record on Ukraine, and 62% disapproving of his handling of foreign affairs in general.BIDENS RELIANCE ON NOTECARDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT FUNDRAISERS WORRIES SOME DONORS: REPORTBiden’s approval rating has not risen above 44% since August 2021, and his 39.8% average rating for his third year in office was the second worst among post-World War II presidents elected to their first term, Brenan observed.If there is a silver lining for the president, its that Americans are slightly more upbeat about his handling of the economy. Low unemployment, stabilizing inflation and record-high stock market numbers have contributed to a four-point increase in his approval ratings on the economy to 36%, up from 32% in the last Gallup survey.That incremental increase was buoyed by independents, who moved six points in Bidens direction to 30% approval on the economy.WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS FEEL HEAT FROM ADMINISTRATION OVER COVERAGE OF BIDEN, TRUMP: NAGGING AND COMPLAININGThe survey results show Biden has some work to do to recapture support from Democrats on immigration and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While about three-quarters of Democrats approve of his handling of the economy, only 55% approve of Bidens job on immigration, and 51% rate him positively on situations in the Middle East.Overall, Bidens approval rating among Democrats stands at 82%, but is still lower than the near-unanimous approval Gallup recorded during his first 11 months in office, Brenan said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRepublicans unsurprisingly rate Biden poorly, giving him just 3% approval on immigration and 4% on the economy.Independents give Biden a 32% approval rating, which is largely unchanged from previous Gallup surveys.The Gallup survey was conducted by telephone interviews from Feb. 1-20, with a random sample of 1,016 American adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

Their crime? Arriving at an abortion clinic before it opened and sitting in prayer while handing out flyers that shared the value of human life.These pro-life activists were convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a 1994 statute that makes it a federal crime to interfere in any way with a person’s attempt to get medical services.Initially, the FACE Act was passed to protect both the supposed right to access abortions and the right to protest peacefully, as well as the safety of churches and pregnancy centers. Sadly, churches and pregnancy resource centers have been subject to a spree of violent attacks in the wake of the Dobbs decision, to which the Biden administration has turned a blind eye.BIDENS TEAM INSISTTS PRESIDENT IS FIT TO SERVE. SO LETS SEE THE HUR TAPES, TRANSCRIPTS AND RECORDINGSHowever, under the Biden administration’s weaponized Justice Department, the FACE Act is primarily being used to go after people of faith who stand up for what they believe and protest to protect innocent life. Each of these 11 peaceful protesters now faces up to 10 and a half years in prison and fines of up to $260,000 for participating in that day of prayerful protest.Luckily, Congressman Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have moved to repeal the FACE Act and replace it with a bill of their own, titled the Restoring the First Amendment and Right to Peaceful Civil Disobedience Act, which would prevent the Biden administration from weaponizing the federal government against Christian conservatives.But the weaponization of government against conservatives and people of faith doesn’t end there. After a man took down a Satanist statute that was placed in the Iowa state Capitol building last December, he was charged with a felony hate crime.PRO-LIFE PROTESTERS CONVICTED OF VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW FOR BLOCKING ABORTION CLINIC DOORIowa law defines this as a violation of individual rights, even though the Satanic temple explicitly admits it is not a religious organization with a belief in a higher power. Not only is Iowa making a mockery of the free exercise of religious rights by treating the Satanists as a religious organization, but Iowa is also making a mockery of the justice system by labeling this destruction of property as a hate crime.Perhaps even more disturbingly, in 2021, the Biden administration released a memo instructing the Department of Justice to go after concerned parents at school board meetings after receiving a letter that compared these parents to domestic terrorists. Last year, it was also revealed that the FBI mounted a spying program on traditional Catholics (particularly those interested in the Latin Mass) and identified them as individuals who might be part of the far-right nationalist movement.In the eyes of the Biden Department of Justice, these Christian patriots are the actual threat to the American way of life – not the criminals who are carjacking, terrorizing and even killing everyday Americans in our cities.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMany of these conservative Christians are facing harsher penalties than those who committed acts of arson and vandalism in the BLM riots of 2020 and even the six illegal immigrants who recently assaulted multiple police officers in New York City, five of whom were released on bail.The administration has clearly made use of the justice system against their political enemies. It’s clear they consider everyone who opposes their views as their enemies as well.These unprecedented acts of weaponization of the Justice Department prove that the Biden administration is eager to deploy the full force of the federal government against its perceived political enemies while letting real crimes, such as the D.C. riots and the destruction of federal property, go unpunished.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs Americans continue to fall victim to rising crime and violence in their neighborhoods, the Biden administration should focus on keeping our communities safe and putting real criminals behind bars. The Department of Justice should never be used as a weaponized arm of the executive branch to harass, intimidate, and stifle political opposition.The American people should demand better from the Biden administration. If President Biden continues to go after Christians and other people of faith while letting the real criminals run free, justice remains nowhere to be found in the DOJ except for its name.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Europe was also a top threat, with 32% of attacks targeting organizations there. Industrial ransomware attacks spiked nearly 50% on a global scale, growing to 905 last year compared to 600 in 2022.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTERWhat is ransomware?In a ransomware attack, hackers will encrypt data on a system and demand a ransom to restore access to the owners. They may also threaten to delete or leak the data if you dont pay. While these attacks tend to target large organizations, some hacker groups will also target individuals.In fact, anyone who uses a computer or a device connected to the internet can be a potential victim of ransomware. This means that your personal files, such as your photos, videos, documents and emails, could be locked by hackers who demand a ransom for their release.MORE: RANSOMWARE RAMPAGE HITS RECORD HIGH WITH US ITS TOP TARGETWhat can I do to protect myself from ransomware?Ransomware criminals will try to get you to pay money to them to get your files back. However, paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will regain access to anything a criminal takes from you and will only permit them to do it more.Your best bet is to prevent an attacker from gaining access to your files altogether so that you dont have to try to fight to get them back. Here are some of my tips for avoiding having your data stolen in a ransomware attack.MORE: TIPS TO FOLLOW FROM ONE INCREDIBLY COSTLY CONVERSATION WITH CYBERCROOKS1) Be careful about opening suspicious links or attachmentsIf you receive an email from an address you do not recognize, don’t open it. If you open it by mistake, avoid clicking any links or opening any attachments inside the email. Cybercriminals use this to try to trick you into thinking that the message is from someone important.2) Have good antivirus protectionGood antivirus software is a major help when it comes to keeping hackers out of your devices. It makes sure you dont click any potentially malicious links or download malware or ransomware. Plus, it’s designed to tell you if theres already malware on your device so that you can immediately work towards getting rid of it. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices .3) Back up your files on an external hard driveYou should create backups of your information on an external hard drive and store it securely in a safe location. This process involves regularly making backup copies from your Windows or Mac computer and then disconnecting the external drive from your computer for added safety. You should store the disconnected drive in a secure place like a fireproof safe or a safe deposit box. By keeping the drive unplugged when not in use, you significantly minimize the risk of unauthorized access to your data by hackers. Check out my top recommendations for external hard drives here .4) Keep software up to dateRegularly update your operating system , antivirus software, web browsers and other applications to make sure you have the latest security patches and protections.5) Use strong and unique passwordsCreate strong passwords for your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. This will make it harder for hackers to access your data or infect your devices with ransomware. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords. It will help you to create unique and difficult-to-crack passwords that a hacker could never guess. Second, it also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and fills passwords in for you when you’re logging into an account so that you never have to remember them yourself. The fewer passwords you remember, the less likely you will be to reuse them for your accounts. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 .MORE: WATCH OUT FOR THIS NEW MALICIOUS RANSOMWARE DISGUISED AS WINDOWS UPDATESHow to respond to a ransomware attackDo not pay the ransom. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will get your data back, and it may encourage the attackers to target you again.Disconnect your device from the internet and any other networks. This may prevent the ransomware from spreading to other devices or encrypting more data.Contact law enforcement and report the incident. They may be able to help you recover your data or track down the attackers. You can find a list of law enforcement contacts for ransomware attacks on the CISA website .Restore your data from backups. If you have backups of your important data, you may be able to restore them to a clean device. Make sure that your backups are not infected by the ransomware and that you scan them for malware before restoring them.Use identity theft protection. If you are a victim of a ransomware attack, you may want to consider investing in identity theft protection.If you want a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process, one of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.

But all are motivated by the perception that Yale today appears to be struggling to meet its most important responsibilities as an academic institution in a clear and consistent way.The development comes as free speech concerns remain prevalent on campuses across the U.S., particularly as a slew of hot-button issues – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 2024 presidential election and even more internal discussions about DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) initiatives or courses rooted in critical race theory – have taken center stage in media coverage.Just months ago, the House of Representatives education committee unveiled a report detailing examples of free speech infringement on college campuses, sounding the alarm over alleged partisanship and political activism through methods including shout-downs, cancellations and rescinded invitations for guest speakers.FREE SPEECH CONTROVERSIES ERUPT ON TODAYS COLLEGE CAMPUSESIt also follows in the footsteps of faculty members at other major academic institutions who have advocated for similar issues, including Princeton, Dartmouth, the University of Chicago and the University of Austin.Faculty for Yale, according to its list of commitments, seeks to acknowledge distinctions between teaching and activism, facilitate more opportunities for open engagement and expression and encourage institutional neutrality.The list also expresses commitment to a tolerant and broad-minded campus ethos and culture and urges commitment to greater transparency.One important corollary is that Yale as an institution should not prescribe any moral or political positions as institutional orthodoxy or treat the failure to endorse such a position as grounds for sanction or exclusion, whether formal or informal, the webpage reads.‘THE VIEW HOSTS CLASH OVER RISING ANTISEMITISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, FREE SPEECH: ‘LET HER TALK!’Doing so thins our collective knowledge and experience and diminishes the truth-seeking enterprise in which we are all engaged.Yale Daily News, an independent student newspaper, reported Monday that over 100 professors have signed on to support Faculty for Yale.Fox News Digital reached out to Yale University for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.

Logistically, it’s very difficult, Baier said as he finished off a series of exclusive interviews near the front lines with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Special Report.Weve had scores and scores of staff members, photographers, engineers come through here in Kyiv, in Lviv and Warsaw, covering this over the past two years, Baier said.Baier paid homage to the nearly dozen correspondents and reporters who went out to the field to cover the war and helped Americans see the true devastation of Russia’s unprovoked attack: Trey Yingst, Lucas Tomlinson, Mike Tobin, Jeff Paul, Greg Palkot, Alexis McAdams, Amy Kellogg, Griff Jenkins, Jonathan Hunt, Alex Hogan, Aishah Hasnie, Steve Harrigan, Jennifer Griffin, Nate Foy, Matt Finn and Benjamin Hall.TRUMP SAID HE COULD END UKRAINE WAR NEARLY A YEAR AGO BUT STILL HASNT LAID OUT SPECIFICSHall in particular gave Baier a moment to pause and recall the toll that war journalism can often take. Hall and his team came under fire while traversing Ukraine between conflict zones, which killed beloved Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Sasha Kuvshynova.Hall suffered catastrophic injuries, requiring 30 surgeries that ultimately could not save one of his legs on one side and his foot on the other, as well as the loss of function of a hand and one eye.JACK KEANE REVEALS BEST WAY TO ‘AVENGE’ NAVALNYS DEATHHall has recounted the harrowing experience, both in his book Saved: A War Reporter’s Mission to Make it Home and on Fox News programs such as Fox & Friends.It was like everything I was trying to do was to get home, get back to my family, Hall said of his experiences, and he has returned to the field to report on Ukraine once again.US EXPECTED TO HIT RUSSIA WITH SANCTIONS ON OVER 500 TARGETS: ‘NOT JUST AMERICA’Baier also used his moment of reflection to once more draw attention to the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who remains in Russian custody until at least Mar. 30 after a Russian court rejected his latest appeal.Journalism is not a crime, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said in a statement Wednesday after visiting Gershkovich at the prison. We condemn the Kremlin’s continued repression of independent voices in Russia, and its ongoing attempts to corrupt the truth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe charges against Evan are baseless, and we call on the Russian Federation to immediately release him, the ambassador said.Baier capped off his reflections by noting that covering war is tough, but we will continue to: Fair, balanced and unafraid.Fox News Digital’s Stephen Sorace and Brian Flood contributed to this report.

Former President Donald Trump has vowed to deport mass numbers of illegal aliens if elected.A deal between the two countries in October to fly illegal Venezuelan migrants directly back to their home country was meant to be a signal from the White House that it was vigorously tackling the issue in the wake of mounting criticism.The deal saw the U.S. send around 1,800 Venezuelans on 15 flights, but the agreement was stalled last month and has now stopped, the Journal reports.FEDERAL JUDGE TORCHES BIDEN ADMIN FOR COLLUDING WITH ACTIVIST GROUP ON ASYLUM RULE: FRENEMIESThe U.S. has lifted sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and other sectors, while Maduro’s regime agreed to allow elections later this year in the hope of reviving its economy. Venezuela has also asserted a claim to a resource-rich region of neighboring Guyana, drawing further warnings from the U.S., the Journal reports.But last month Washington ordered a wind-down of all business transactions between U.S. entities and Venezuelas state miner Minerven and said it would unwind its easing of energy sanctions if Maduros administration did not stick to the agreement and accept conditions for a fair presidential election.The South American countrys top court upheld a ban blocking the leading opposition hopeful, Maria Corina Machado, from the election.The U.S. restored sanctions on Venezuela’s gold sector on February 13.The flights were seen as a way of deterring Venezuelan migrants from making the treacherous journey to the U.S., as their chances of being deported would increase. A similar measure was effective in curtailing a surge of Haitian migrants aiming to get into the U.S. last year, the Journal reports.BIDEN ADMIN WEIGHS EXECUTIVE ACTION ON BORDER CRISIS, DRAWING FIRE FROM LEFT AND RIGHTHowever, the number of Venezuelans being deported represents only a fraction of those who have crossed the border illegally under the Biden administration.Just over 830 Venezuelan border-crossers were reported in fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), despite 335,000 Venezuelan citizens being encountered by border authorities.More than 201,000 of them were apprehended by Border Patrol agents after crossing illegally into the U.S. The rest were encountered at ports of entry, which would include CBP One app paroles into the U.S.The news also comes as some Venezuelans are now admitting to committing crimes in Chicago as a way of being sent back to the South American country, according to CWB Chicago.Two Venezuelan migrants recently arrested for committing different crimes in the Windy City told police they had turned to crime because they wanted to be sent back to Venezuela, the outlet reports, citing their CPD arrest reports.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMigrant Dhian Gomez-Mendoza told authorities that he is so desperate to go back to Venezuela that he will do whatever it takes, if that is beating up a police officer or hurting a civilian, he will do it.Gomez-Mendoza made the claims after he was arrested at O’Hare International Airport on February 7 for screaming and yelling while running in and out of Terminal 3. When they asked him to leave, he fell to his knees and threw his hands into the air declaring that he was desperate to return home, CWB Chicago reports.The following day, he was arrested at Midway International Airport, where police said he kicked and damaged the fender of their Segway as they escorted him out of the employee parking lot.Another migrant, Jhoni Montes, was arrested at Macy’s, 111 North State, on February 9 for trying to shoplift three suitcases worth over $1,600 with another person. While being charged with retail theft, he told officers, he was stealing to go back to Venezuela, according to CWB Chicago, citing his arrest report.

The rare enigmatic stone box was found by the Israel Antiquities Authority during excavations in the City of David.The box is carved from limestone and measures 30 x 30 centimeters in size. The box features nine equal-sized compartments, with blackened sides, indicating burning, according to a press release about the rare object. This burning could have been from the Great Jewish Revolt.HIKER IN ISRAEL DISCOVERS ANCIENT SCARAB DATING BACK NEARLY 2,800 YEARSThe Great Jewish Revolt was from 66-70 CE. The rebellion in Judea was led by Jews fighting against the Roman Empire.Researchers predict that boxes like the one recently found were used for commercial reasons.During the excavations of the Pilgrimage Road, where the box was discovered, many objects have been found testament to the flourishing commercial activity that took place alongside the road during the Second Temple period, Dr. Yuval Baruch and Ari Levy, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority said per the press release.During the excavations we have uncovered ceramic and glass vessels, production and cooking facilities, various measuring tools, stone weights and coins. Together, these objects suggest that the road was connected to commercial activities such as a lively urban market. The Pilgrimage Road connecting the Pool of Siloam to the Temple Mount was the main thoroughfare of the city 2,000 years ago. It seems that the newly discovered box was related to this commercial activity that took place along the Pilgrimage Road, Barunch and Levy added.SMALL FRAGMENTS OF ANCIENT ROOF TILES FOUND IN THE CITY OF DAVID PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF JERUSALEMS HISTORYIt seems that the multi-compartment stone box from the City of David was related to the unique Jerusalem economy conducted in the shadow of the temple maintaining strict observance and in accordance with purity laws. Therefore, we can consider this box a distinctly Jerusalem find, Levy and Dr. Baruch concluded.This is not the first time that a box has been discovered. Pieces of a box similar to the one recently found were discovered about 50 years ago by Nachman Avigad.Even though researchers point to commercial use as the purpose of a box like this, they still have questions about what exactly it was used for.Now, visitors can see the rare discovery on full display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe box was found broken into pieces with parts missing. The fragments were brought to Victor Uziel, conservationist from the Israel Museum Artifact Conservation Laboratory which specializes in treatment and restoration of artifacts directly from the field. We placed the stone box on permanent display together with spectacular colorful frescos, chandeliers and magnificent pottery, stone and metal vessels from Jerusalems luxury houses dating to the end of the Second Temple period - you are invited to come and see them.

Authorities on Friday afternoon said there are no more missing people. Spanish media had reported that as many as 15 people were unaccounted for.The fire started on the fourth floor of one part of the complex and quickly spread to an adjacent building.POLICE: MISSOURI FIRE THAT KILLED A WOMAN AND HER 4 CHILDREN WAS A MURDER-SUICIDEDramatic video from the scene shows the entire complex engulfed in flames as firefighters desperately attempt to put the raging inferno out. Flames could be seen bursting from windows while firefighters used a crane to lift two residents from one of the balconies.A firefighter also had to jump from the first floor to a crash mat below.Dark smoke could be seen billowing up into the night sky while strong winds of up to 40 mph were reported by Spain’s weather agency Aemet and are thought to have played a part in the fires rapid spread.Some 90 soldiers from Spain’s Military Emergency Unit and 40 firefighting trucks were also deployed.There are fears that the building’s cladding may have helped the fire spread quickly, akin to the Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017 that killed 72 people.7 OF 9 LOS ANGELES FIREFIGHTERS OUT OF HOSPITAL AFTER TRUCK BLASTThe building featured a polyurethane material that is no longer in wide use due to fears over flammability, while it also has an aluminum covering, Esther Puchades, the vice president of the College of Industrial Technical Engineers of Valencia, told Spanish news agency EFE.Around 450 people are believed to live in the apartment blocks, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, although it is unclear how many were there when the fire broke out.The building, consisting of two towers linked by what its developers described as a panoramic lift, had 138 apartments, El Pais reported.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFirefighters continued to hose down parts of the gutted building some 15 hours after the blaze started, with pictures on Friday revealing the structure’s charred remains.Valencia Mayor María José Catalá said that both the danger of the 14-story building collapsing and the intense heat from the fire had prevented emergency workers from getting in to search for possible survivors.On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited the scene to offer his sympathies.The city has decreed three days of mourning and suspended the start of a monthlong annual festival.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

But it also hurts developing nations such as Kenya.Kenya, a vibrant East African nation stands at an economic crossroads – with questions on energy being the most urgent.Kenya’s burgeoning population of 55 million people mirrors the combined populations of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The country’s landmass, at 224,960 square miles, is slightly smaller than Texas but larger than California, highlighting the vastness of the region that energy solutions are required to meet.BIDENS NATURAL GAS DECISION IS NUTS. CLIMATE EXTREMISTS DONT KNOW THE FACTSAccess to energy is a big challenge in Kenya.According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the energy landscape in Kenya is characterized by its reliance on renewable resources, mostly geothermal and hydropower, and to a lesser extent, wind and solar energy. But that’s just electricity.Some 70% of Kenya’s energy is from burning biomass, which is a fancy term for charcoal, firewood, cow dung and crop residue. In the rural areas, it’s as high as 90% – and it’s dirty and harmful to health.A quick comparison between Kenya and the U.S. illuminates the challenge.On a per capita basis in 2021, America produced 165 times more energy than did Kenya while consuming 44 times more energy. Try to apply that to your own life – using almost 98% less energy in your daily routine: 98% less heating or air conditioning, 98% less personal transportation, 98% less internet use, and 98% less industrial output.HOUSE DELIVERS BLOW TO BIDENS CLIMATE AGENDA, VOTES AGAINST NATURAL GAS MORATORIUMThe need for more energy in Kenya cannot be overstated. Access to reliable and affordable energy is a cornerstone of economic development, facilitating industries, improving education and health care services, and ultimately, enhancing the quality of life – even lifespans – the average American lifespan in 2020 was 77.3 years, vs. 61.7 in Kenya.However, the current energy infrastructure in Kenya struggles to provide consistent power, with frequent outages impacting both urban and rural areas. Kenya generates 3300 MW of electricity with about 80% of the power consumed from clean energy sources. And that number is still rising.About 45% of Kenya’s power is from geothermal, 40% from hydro, 15% from fossil fuels and 5% from solar and wind. Kenya has the largest wind farm in Africa, contributing 310 MW of electricity to the national grid on a windy day.But the government’s chase for solar and wind has seen electricity prices soar, with power more expensive than the average for the U.S. or China.STATE AGS WARN BIDENS NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSALGrid reliability is a concern too, with many regions experiencing several hours of power outages daily, which significantly hampers productivity and economic growth.Comparative Analysis with the United StatesIn stark contrast to Kenya, the United States boasts one of the highest rates of electricity consumption per capita in the world. This high level of energy consumption supports a wide array of economic activities – and a standard of living that is among the highest globally.Kenya is one of the African countries with a bigger percentage of people connected to the national electric grid. Even with 83% of Kenya’s population having access to electricity, the nation’s electricity consumption is very low.Jusper’s family has six members and at the end of the month they use 12-16 kWh (kilowatt hours) for lighting, charging phones, powering a couple of laptops, a TV and a radio. Most families use 4 to 5 kWh a month in Jusper’s village. A typical American refrigerator uses 42 kWh per month and an average American household uses about 899 kWh over the same period.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe Green Energy Debate and Its Implications for KenyaThe push for green energy by Western elites raises critical questions about its applicability for developing countries like Kenya. The transition to renewable energy sources requires significant investment in technology, infrastructure and capacity building.While developed countries may have the resources to invest in these areas, developing nations often find themselves at a disadvantage, lacking the capital, technology and infrastructure to make a seamless transition. Moreover, they need affordable, reliable and abundant energy now – not a few token green energy projects, designed more to assuage Western environmental consciousnesses than to address urgent requirements.Kenyans have faced tough economic times since the IMF pressured money-hungry President Ruto to scrub off fuel subsidies, something that the former government was against. The IMF’s four reasons as to why the Kenyan government should end fuel subsidies ignore the fact that every other industry is run by the energy industry and therefore, higher energy prices means tougher economic times.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe IMF knows that fuel subsidies promote the use of fossil fuels. High fuel prices means that poor people who use kerosene lamps for lighting will now be forced to stay in darkness. Forests will be cleared more because propane prices are also high and burning firewood is the best way to keep energy expenses low.For Kenya, the rush toward green energy consigns its population to continued energy poverty while limiting economic advancement.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHUCK DEVOREJusper Machogu is a farmer, an agricultural engineer, a climate change skeptic, and a Fossil Fuels for Africa advocate.

Tragically, as a result of deeply unfair and political COVID-19 vaccine policies by the Biden administration, tens of thousands of our nation’s finest have been treated by our government more like adversaries than the true heroes they are. It’s time this grievous injustice was finally addressed.The absurdity of this political overreach into our military was clear from the start. In August 2021, Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a COVID-19 vaccine mandate that directed soldiers to receive only fully FDA-licensed vaccines. This was more about virtue signaling than substance. At that time and for nearly a year after the order was issued, the Department of Defense did not even have any fully FDA-licensed vaccines.As a result, thousands of service members – who wanted nothing more than to serve the country – were punished for being unvaccinated even if it was impossible for them to comply with the order. Many were devout Christians who had simply requested reasonable accommodation for their sincerely held beliefs.DEM STATES, CITIES OVERRUN BY MIGRANTS FUNNELED MILLIONS IN FEDERAL COVID-19 AID TO SUPPORT ILLEGALSWithout any form of due process, troops were discharged with severe misconduct codes that prevent reenlistment and denial of veterans and retirement benefits. To add insult to injury, those who were discharged were told they were now in debt for reenlistment, service academy tuition, or GI Bill benefits that can amount to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Even many troops who were not discharged faced other profound consequences, such as cancelation of school and training, negative fitness reports, denial of promotions, denial of pay and involuntary transfer to inactive status.Other horror stories included soldiers denied requests to see dying family members because of restrictions suddenly placed on leave, troops serving abroad whose families were rendered homeless after being evicted from housing and denial of medical care for injuries.Long after President Joe Biden publicly declared the pandemic is over, soldiers continued to have their lives ruined by this policy. And even after the Department of Defense finally ended its COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 2023, the damage from this outrageous and ill-conceived policy did not end there. Tens of thousands of healthy soldiers remained kicked out of the military.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn addition to the basic unfairness, the vaccine mandate has been costly and reckless for our national security. At a time of two major wars abroad and the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the last thing we should do is expel patriotic and capable service members because of politics.Our military is already facing a recruiting and readiness crisis and the vaccine mandate only created a new self-imposed one, threatening our national security and the viability of the all-volunteer force.It would be impossible to fully correct these mistakes because the costs are immeasurable and incalculable. These soldiers and their families will never fully regain their pride in being able to serve their country and their years that were supposed to be devoted to that cause.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHowever, we can – at least – try to send a message to future generations who seek to serve that this will not happen again. We must make it clear to them that their country recognizes this mistake and will not cast them aside like others have been. Compensating servicemembers for lost back pay would be a good first step, but that must only be the start of a comprehensive solution.Politicians in Washington love to talk about how much they support the troops, but rhetoric that’s not backed by action is just words. I urge our leaders in Washington to actually show they support our brave troops by beginning to make this right.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MIKE POMPEO

She also noted that the extent of its impact isn’t clear.Not enough research has been conducted on the matter to give us precise data, she told Fox News Digital.What has been noted is that alcohol abuse — as well as taking a number of other medications — does increase the risk of developing dementia.What amount of alcohol is dangerous?Brain damage and neurocognitive impacts can occur with heavy drinking in individuals with moderate or severe alcohol use disorders, Grasner said — so there is a wide variation between individuals in the quantity of alcohol that leads to these neurotoxic effects.The specific reasons that some individuals develop alcohol-related dementia whereas others do not are not well understood, so we dont currently have guidelines specifying that if you drink a certain amount, you are likely to experience cognitive impairments, she added.Women are generally more vulnerable to the damaging effects of alcohol on the brain and body, Glasner noted, which means the onset can occur at a younger age than it would in men.Expert evaluation of the contribution of substance use and other underlying medical conditions such as Grave’s Disease to cognitive symptoms would be very important for Williams to ensure that she receives the right treatments at the right time, Glasner recommended.STUDY FINDS THAT PROTEINS MAY PREDICT WHO WILL GET DEMENTIA IN 10 YEARS BASED ON BLOOD SAMPLESOften involving a family very closely to evaluate the symptoms and the timing of their emergence relative to alcohol or other substance use can be helpful as part of determining an accurate diagnosis and plan of care , she added.Abstinence from alcohol is a crucial part of treatment for alcohol-related neurological deficits, noted Glasner.In many cases, individuals who misuse or are addicted to alcohol and drugs struggle with overlapping chronic medical and psychiatric conditions.If the condition is caught in time, abstaining from alcohol can at least partially, if not fully, reverse the symptoms, according to the expert.Living with FTD and aphasiaWhile symptoms of FTD can vary depending on what part of the brain is affected, most people with the condition experience some common symptoms, as listed on the Johns Hopkins Medicine website.Behavior or personality changes are often the most obvious indicators. These may include public outbursts or socially inappropriate actions.DEMENTIA AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE IS LINKED TO 15 FACTORS, MAJOR STUDY REVEALSPeople with FTD also tend to have impaired judgment, a lack of empathy and lower self-awareness, Johns Hopkins states.This type of dementia is also marked by a reduced ability to understand or formulate language.People may struggle to remember the names of objects, string words into sentences or even recall the meanings of words they used to know.The condition can also lead to agitation, irritability and drastic mood swings .CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere is no treatment for FTD other than managing symptoms and educating family members and caregivers, according to Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute in New Jersey.Some aphasia symptoms can be managed with speech therapy.The specific reasons why some individuals develop alcohol-related dementia whereas others do not are not well understood.Treatment focuses a great deal on family education, said Reena Gottesman, M.D., a behavioral neurologist at the Center for Brain Loss and Memory Health at Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute, in a press release.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERApproximately 50,000-60,000 people may have FTD, per data from the Alzheimer’s Association, a nonprofit group based in Chicago.Recently, actor Bruce Willis’ FTD diagnosis brought new attention to the rare condition.

children, without limitation.The decision was in response to two wrongful death cases brought by three couples whose frozen embryos were destroyed in an accident at an Alabama fertility clinic.FDA APPROVES FIRST AT-HOME STERILE INSEMINATION KIT TO HELP WITH INFERTILITY: GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPSJustices ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child applies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.Unborn children are ‘children’ ... without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics, Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in the ruling.This includes unborn children who are located outside of a biological uterus at the time they are killed.Pro-life advocacy group Live Action reacted to the decision in a statement.Each person, from the tiniest embryo to an elder nearing the end of his life, has incalculable value that deserves and is guaranteed legal protection, Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action, said in the statement.Fox News Digital reached out to Live Action for additional comment.In the courts ruling, Chief Justice Tom Parker referenced upholding the sanctity of unborn life, a phrase that appears in the Alabama Constitution.Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory, Parker said in the ruling.IVF providers halt servicesIn response to the courts ruling, the largest hospital system in Alabama — the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) — announced on Wednesday that it would be suspending its in-vitro fertilization treatments .The UAB Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility has paused in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as it evaluates the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision that a cryopreserved embryo is a human being, the hospital said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.STUDY SUGGESTS MEDITERRANEAN DIET COULD BOOST MALE FERTILITY: CRUCIAL ROLEWe are saddened that this will impact our patients’ attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments, the statement continued.The hospital noted that other components of fertility treatments — everything through egg retrieval — remain in place, and only the actual egg fertilization and embryo development are paused.On Thursday, two additional fertility providers — Alabama Fertility Specialists and the Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile, Alabama — both announced that they would be pausing their IVF treatments, according to local reports.Doctors weigh inDr. Asima Ahmad, co-founder and chief medical officer of Carrot Fertility and a practicing reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist based in Chicago, Illinois, shared her opinions on the ruling.Access to IVF is now at stake in Alabama due to the recent ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court, she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.CHEMICALS IN WATER AND HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS COULD REDUCE CHANCES OF PREGNANCY, LIVE BIRTHS: NEW STUDYThis decision could have serious consequences for people who are desperately seeking to have children, including clinics shutting down, doctors moving out of the state for fear of practicing, pricing increases, and changes in medical practice to avoid lawsuits, which might not be ideal for the patient.Ahmad warned that the ruling could result in profound damage to fertility care access.IVF is a crucial part of reproductive science and allows women to have children who otherwise couldnt.As physicians, it is our fundamental duty to do no harm, and this could take away our ability to practice medicine in a way that we think is most ethical and safe for our patients, she added.Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, reacted to the ruling’s impact on IVF availability in an interview with Fox News Digital.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERIVF is a crucial part of reproductive science and allows women to have children who otherwise couldnt, he said.Freezing eggs is an important part of the process, because it allows women to utilize these eggs later on when the timing is better or when they have found the right partner.Freezing embryos also allows a couple more options in terms of timing, Siegel said, which may increase the chance of a viable child.It is important that a frozen embryo not be used casually or frozen without plan for use, but I believe that IVF is an important option that brings children to couples, he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCertainly, if your religious

269;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/health/women-get-more-benefit-exercise-men-study-finds-gain;Women get more benefit from exercise than men, study finds: ‘More to gain’;When it comes to reaping the rewards of exercise , women may have a leg up.A new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that females may get more benefits than men when doing the same amount of physical activity.Researchers from the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles analyzed the physical activity data of 412,413 U.S. adults.KIDS WHO WEAR SCHOOL UNIFORMS GET LESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, STUDY FINDS: THERES A PROBLEMThe participants all responded to the National Health Interview Survey database between 1997 and 2019, providing details about the frequency, duration, intensity and type of physical activity, according to a press release from the hospital.In terms of cardiovascular exercise, the researchers found that men gained their maximum survival benefit from doing moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity for about five hours per week.For women, that same level of benefit was achieved after just 2½ hours of that exercise intensity per week.Women continued to gain more benefits after that time, however.THE MORE PEOPLE EXERCISE, THE LAZIER THEY ARE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY, STUDY SUGGESTSExamples of moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity include brisk walking or cycling, the study detailed.For strength training exercises, men hit their maximum benefit from three weekly sessions, while women achieved the same outcome with just one session per week.We found not only that progressively greater amounts of physical activity reduced mortality risk, but also that the amount of regular exercise needed to achieve the same degree of risk reduction was different in females versus males, said senior author Susan Cheng, M.D., MPH, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute.In effect, women did not need to exercise for as much time as men to achieve the same benefit, she told Fox News Digital.Put another way, for a given amount of time and effort put into exercise, women had more to gain than men.Co-lead author Martha Gulati, M.D., director of preventive cardiology in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai, noted in the release that women have historically and statistically lagged behind men in engaging in exercise.Exercise doesn’t discriminate, no matter your gender. You have to put the work in to be healthy.The beauty of this study is learning that women can get more out of each minute of moderate to vigorous activity than men do, Gulati said.It’s an incentivizing notion that we hope women will take to heart.While mortality risk decreased for all adults, it was reduced by 24% for women and 15% for men, according to Cheng.We hope that the results of this study will help to motivate females who are not currently engaged in regular physical activity to understand that they are in a position to gain substantial benefit, technically even more than their counterpart males, for each increment of regular exercise they are able to invest in their longer-term health, Cheng told Fox News Digital.Part of what makes females and males different is that when it comes to living longer and living healthier, different types of investments are linked to different types of gains.ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTSThe researchers hope that these findings will help women who may feel too busy or too intimidated to take on a new exercise routine without feeling that they have to compare themselves to men.They can be on their own path to success and every bit of progress will count, Cheng said.Chris Pruitt, a certified personal trainer with the American Sports and Fitness Association (ASFA) who is based in Maryland, was not involved in the study but said it aligns with observations that women and men may require different approaches to achieve similar health outcomes .In my experience, individual responses to exercise can vary widely, and its fascinating to see this backed by research, he told Fox News Digital.Biological differences between genders, including hormonal variations and body composition, likely play a significant role in these observed differences, Pruitt went on.Women may use energy or recover from exercise differently than men, leading to these distinct benefits from less exercise.5 WAYS TO STICK WITH YOUR ‘EXERCISE MORE’ NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION IN 2024, FROM A NEW YORK DOCTORThis research illustrates the importance of personalized fitness programs that consider gender differences, he said.It suggests that fitness advice should be more tailored to the individuals goals and abilities and their gender-specific physiological responses to exercise.Potential limitationsThe chief limitation of the study is that all physical activity data was self-reported — which creates the possibility for inaccuracies.In the future, direct measures of exercise could be analyzed using wearable devices , Cheng said.A very large study of people whose exercise is digitally tracked and measured could one day give us even more detailed information on differences not only between women and men, but also within women and within men.There is still a lot more work we need to do to figure out how to best tailor exercise recommendations to each individual person to best meet their individual needs.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERJosh York, founder and CEO of the New York-based fitness training company GYMGUYZ, reviewed the study and said he does not think the findings should influence peoples fitness routines.There are a lot of things you need for good health and fitness, including proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle , he told Fox News Digital.There are a lot of different variables at play when it comes to assessing a person’s exercise needs and requirements.While the study looked at maximal survival benefit, York noted that some people might be motivated by other goals, such as looking a certain way.At the end of the day, exercise doesn’t discriminate, no matter your gender, he said. You have to put the work in to be healthy. If someone puts more work in, has a healthy diet and lives in a safe environment, they are going to get better results, because physical health is influenced by your habits and mental well-being.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs each individual is different, York said that sweeping assumptions about each gender’s exercise needs and outcomes don’t take into account variations in individuals’ circumstances.I don’t think people should use this as guidance to reduce their exercise regimens, he said.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.Someone with COVID-19 might expect to experience fatigue, cold and flu symptoms , and loss of taste and smell — but a paralyzed diaphragm would likely not be on the radar.It was certainly a surprise to Gerald Branim, 55, a runner from Tennessee. His life took a drastic turn when COVID-19 damaged his lungs and diaphragm to the extent that he was unable to run or walk for a year.Branim and his doctor, Matthew Kaufman of the Institute of Advanced Reconstruction in New Jersey, joined Fox News Digital in an interview to discuss Branim’s ordeal and recovery.LARGEST-EVER COVID VACCINE STUDY LINKS SHOT TO SMALL INCREASE IN HEART AND BRAIN CONDITIONSWhen Branim got COVID in Feb. 2021, he was a fit, healthy 52-year-old who ran marathons.In spite of that, the infection caused significant lung damage. He spent two weeks in the hospital and three months out of work.For two months after leaving the hospital, Branim used a walker as he continued struggling with lung complications.For someone who had run marathons, it was quite humbling to have to walk with a walker for three months, he said.After rounds of high-dose steroids and lots of antibiotics, Branim’s chest X-rays finally showed that his lungs had cleared — but he was still having trouble functioning.LONG COVID IS HIGHEST IN THESE STATES, SAYS NEW CDC REPORTI still couldn’t go upstairs without my oxygen dropping severely, he recalled. I couldnt run 100 yards without my oxygen dropping into dangerous levels. I was severely out of breath.Thats when they started saying something else was going on — that this shouldnt be happening.I couldnt run 100 yards without my oxygen dropping into dangerous levels. I was severely out of breath.After 10 months of not being able to walk or run, Branim’s condition was finally diagnosed via a sniff test, which is also called a chest fluoroscopy or a video chest X-ray, where the patient is asked to breathe in and out.Any paralysis will show up on the scan, as the diaphragm won’t move upon breathing.What to know about diaphragm paralysisDiaphragm paralysis — which is a pretty rare condition, according to Kaufman, Branims doctor — is paralysis of the diaphragm muscle, which is the primary breathing muscle.Previous studies have estimated that the condition affects only about 1.31% of the population. In about 95% of cases, only one side is paralyzed, the doctor noted.We have two diaphragms, one on the right, one on the left, he said.In cases where both sides are paralyzed, symptoms will be much more severe, usually requiring the patient to be put on oxygen.It’s become sort of a phenomenon, Kaufman told Fox News Digital. The phrenic nerve, which is the nerve that controls the diaphragm, seems to be an area where the COVID virus can have an impact.In some ways, he said, the condition can be considered part of long COVID, which is when symptoms of the virus linger for weeks, months or even years after infection.SHOULD THE CDC DROP ITS 5-DAY COVID ISOLATION GUIDELINES? DOCTORS WEIGH INMost people with diaphragm paralysis won’t have difficulty breathing while sitting. Symptoms will typically emerge with exertion, such as walking or exercising, or when changing positions, such as lying flat in bed or bending over to tie their shoes, Kaufman said.Some people are more susceptible than others, the doctor noted.We know that viruses tend to attack nerves in the body, as we’ve seen in Bell’s palsy, he said. And now we’re seeing it with COVID causing injury to the phrenic nerve.Because the condition is rare to begin with, he said, it’s not something that’s universally known.And then you take a condition like COVID, which causes respiratory symptoms from inflammation in the airways and lungs, and then you tie in what we consider to be a neuromuscular problem, Kaufman said.A lot of times, the physician or patient will attribute it to airway inflammation, when in fact its a problem related to nerves and muscles that are part of the respiratory system.ASK A DOC: WHEN IS A COUGH SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT?In some cases, patients will recover on their own, Kaufman said.We usually recommend a period of about six to 12 months of physical therapy , breathing exercises and cardiovascular fitness to try to see if this will come back on its own, he said.If improvement is not noticed in that time frame, surgical intervention becomes a possibility.In 2020 and 2021, Kaufman said he saw an uptick of patients who experienced diaphragm paralysis after having COVID. Although he is still seeing some cases, they are starting to trail off a bit.That could be because the classic COVID is not as virulent or severe, he said. Or maybe it’s because more people are immunized.Although the condition is generally not life-threatening, it can be more severe in patients who have existing respiratory conditions.Racing toward recoveryAfter Branim’s diagnosis, his lung doctor advised him to continue to give it time to heal.But it wasn’t getting any better, he said. And I just wasnt satisfied with that being my new quality of life.WELLNESS SHOTS AT HOME CAN HELP YOU BEAT THE COLD THATS HAMPERING YOU: TRY THE RECIPEThat’s when Branim turned to Google to research surgical options. He came across an article by Kaufman, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specializes in an area called peripheral nerve microsurgery .Kaufman specializes in conditions that cause either pain or paralysis due to nerve damage of the peripheral nervous system.After meeting with Kaufman in a telehealth visit, Branim was identified as a prime candidate for the surgery, which is called phrenic nerve reconstruction.It wasn’t getting any better — and I just wasnt satisfied with that being my new quality of life.If he had waited much longer, he said, his diaphragm muscle would have atrophied and the surgery would no longer have been possible.After a lot of back and forth with the insurance company, Branim finally got the green light to travel from Nashville to New Jersey for the procedure.The surgery went smoothly, although Branim was told that it wouldn’t be an immediate improvement. Once the nerve is fixed, the muscle still needs time to strengthen and rehabilitate.Dr. Kaufman told me that it would probably take a year or two to recover fully, and was preaching patience — but Im not a patient man in the slightest sense of the word, Branim laughed.He set a goal of running a half-marathon within a year of his surgery date.After four weeks, Branim slowly began exercising again. After six months, he decided to lace up his running shoes and give it a try.My very first run after the surgery, I ran five miles, he said. I literally cried. At that point, it was like a light switch had been flipped.MASK MANDATES RETURN TO HOSPITALS IN NYC, SEVERAL OTHER STATES AMID RISE IN COVID, FLU CASESWithin six months, Branim had not only regained his ability to run, but exceeded his original goals, culminating in a half-marathon in April 2023.In a triumphant twist, Kaufman, who is also a runner, joined his patient in completing the race in Asbury Park, New Jersey.Now, Branim aims to raise awareness about diaphragm paralysis, an often-overlooked condition that is not on most doctors’ or patients’ radars.None of my doctors had even heard of this surgery, he said. Had I not found the article about Dr. Kaufman and another runner online, I would have never been able to have the surgery — and I would absolutely not be running today.Branim emphasized the importance of patients serving as their own advocates.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERDoctors are human — they dont know everything, he said. So you have to advocate for yourself.For patients who are experiencing shortness of breath with exertion that persists for several months, Kaufman recommends visiting a primary care physician or pulmonary physician to get the necessary testing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile most tests will find more common ailments, it definitely makes sense to keep a paralyzed diaphragm on the list of things to rule out.

274;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/black-history-10-famous-figures-us;Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson, MLK Jr. and other famous figures to remember during Black History Month;Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown colony – near present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite challenges throughout the nation’s history and left their mark on American culture.Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions and achievements of African Americans.BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTEThe theme for February is African Americans and the Arts, with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists, athletes and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.Here are 13 famous figures and the contributions they made to American history.Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York – where slavery was still legal at the time.She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.TARGET PULLS BLACK HISTORY MONTH PRODUCT FROM SHELVES THAT MIXED UP THREE CIVIL RIGHTS ICONSBy 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.Baumfree famously delivered her Ain’t I a Woman? speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave (1850).Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in Feb. 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? speech (1852) and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass autobiography (1881).BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTHDouglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad.Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.She personally made about 13 trips into Maryland to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to about 70 more, according to the NPS.When the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Col. James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing and cooking aid.Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor of science degree, according to History.com.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEBRUARY 3, 1870, 15TH AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED, GRANTING BLACK MALES THE RIGHT TO VOTECarver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for, that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.Some of her famous written works include Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (1893) and Mob Rule in New Orleans (1900).Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, ALBERTA KING, ‘GAVE HER ALL FOR CHRIST’He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a masters and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published books on sociology, history and politics, including Black Reconstruction in America, The Souls of Black Folk and The Talented Tenth.Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that builds Black political power to end structural racism.Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.10 FACTS ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAT ARE WELL WORTH KNOWING DURING OBSERVANCES IN FEBRUARYMarshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were separate but equal.Marshall found this doctrine flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court – where he served as a justice until 1991.Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband, Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue.

Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.From Kings opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.Explore Kings profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.War Poverty Segregation Voting LegacyMARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY1. WarThe idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America, King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.2. PovertyDuring the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLEThe members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.3. SegregationKing fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.He famously delivered his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.Just four days after Parks arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end, he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLKS ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: WE STILL HAVE A DREAMA federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.4. VotingKing advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.Kings involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nations first Black president.5. LegacyAs King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF USWe have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But Ive come to believe were integrating into a burning house, King said. Im afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And Im afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following Kings assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he brought it on himself.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.

Secretary-General António Guterres said there is an urgent need for dialogue between rival generals to end the conflict.The U.N. human rights office said in a new report Friday that scores of people, including children, have been subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence in the ongoinng conflict in Sudan, assaults that may amount to war crimes.Sudan plunged into chaos in mid-April when clashes erupted in the capital, Khartoum, between rival Sudanese forces — the country’s military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and a paramilitary faction known as the Rapid Support Forces, under the command of Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.The fighting quickly spread across the African country, especially urban areas but also the restive western Darfur region, and has so far killed at least 12,000 people and sent over 8 million fleeing their homes, the report said.RASHIDA TLAIB VOTES PRESENT ON NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOTE TO CONDEMN HAMAS USE OF RAPE AS WEAPON OF WARThe report, which covers a period from the outbreak of the fighting up to Dec. 15, documents abuses in a country that has been largely inaccessible to aid groups and rights monitors recently, clouding the impact of a conflict that been overshadowed by wars in places like Gaza and Ukraine.The report found that at least 118 people had been subjected to sexual violence, including rape — with many of the assaults committed by members of the paramilitary forces, in homes and on the streets.One woman, the U.N. said, was held in a building and repeatedly gang-raped over a period of 35 days.The report also pointed to recruitment of child soldiers on both sides of the conflict.Some of these violations would amount to war crimes, said U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk, calling for prompt, thorough and independent investigations into alleged rights abuses and violations.The report is based on interview of more than 300 victims and witnesses, some conducted in neighboring Ethiopia and Chad where many Sudanese have fled, along with analysis of photographs, videos, and satellite imagery from the conflict areas.The ravages of the war, beyond the period examined, are continuing, the U.N. said.The U.N. cited video that emerged last week from the countrys North Kordofan State showing men wearing Sudanese army uniforms carrying severed heads of members of the rival paramilitary faction.ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATICFor nearly a year now, accounts coming out of Sudan have been of death, suffering and despair, as the senseless conflict and human rights violations and abuses have persisted with no end in sight, Türk said.The guns must be silenced, and civilians must be protected, he added.Speaking from Nairobi, Kenya, by videoconference to the U.N. briefing in Geneva on Friday, Seif Magango, a regional spokesman for the U.N. human rights office said that the number of people displaced (in Sudan) has now crossed the 8 million mark, which should concern everyone.Earlier in February, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters that there is no military solution to Sudans conflict and urged the rival generals to start talking about ending the conflict. He stressed that continued fighting will not bring any solution so we must stop this as soon as possible.

I think teams are going to love his ability to create and his ability to take off and run, too.McCarthy has become one of the most fascinating prospects to discuss at this point in the pre-draft process. His stock has seemingly risen over the past few weeks.He also still has the opportunity to try and impress teams at the upcoming combine and his pro day.Michigan relied heavily on its running backs during McCarthys tenure, but he did show the ability to make accurate throws.Quinn acknowledged the offensive structure that McCarthy played in at Michigan, but also pointed to his ability to showcase his talent when it was necessary.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThis is a team thats really run the football incredibly well, Quinn said in reference to the Wolverines offense.[McCarthy] hasnt had to necessarily dominate games. Ill still go back to when hes had to do it, hes showcased the ability to. ... Hes able to layer the ball which is another thing you always hear talked about this time of year. The ability to get it over one defender, but in front of the next or inside a tight window. He showcases all of that.

The role of paternal grandparents was smaller, the study found.Grandparental characteristics associated with increased potential for providing support and decreased need of receiving support predict a lower likelihood of maternal depression, particularly among separating mothers, the researchers stated in the findings.In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, study co-author Dr. Niina Metsa-Simola mentioned that the differences in maternal mental health could be larger in the US than in Finland, particularly when mothers separate.This is because Finland is a comprehensive Nordic welfare state that offers relatively generous support measures, including affordable childcare, she said. Furthermore, multigenerational households (that is, grandparents living together with their adult children and grandchildren) are highly uncommon in Finland.Matt Lundquist, LCSW, MSED, a psychotherapist at Tribeca Therapy in New York City, was not involved in the study but reacted to the findings in an interview with Fox News Digital.In many cases, she said the most helpful form of mental health intervention is a sense of community and support from loved ones.Moms who had their own mothers living close by were less likely to be depressed.While there can be psychiatric issues that need attention from a mental health professional, often the kinds of community support, family support, caring and nurturing that new moms and new parents get is incredibly significant, he said.The support of a maternal figure who can offer woman-to-woman guidance is especially important, Lundquist noted.Women face the challenges of the change in identity that comes with new motherhood, particularly if it’s their first time giving birth, he said.And also, [they face] the challenges of learning to take care of a little baby and become a parent, Lundquist said. A lot of folks reach for support from their moms or from somebody who can be a stand-in with some wisdom and experience.ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTSIn terms of tackling postpartum depression, Lundquist said that being a new mom is an underappreciated challenge — which is where grandparents can step in.When we think about the role that [the mothers] parents play, especially her mom, theres a particular form of guidance in navigating those shifts in identity and creating space to talk about that, he said.Educational psychologist and parenting expert Dr. Michele Borba, who was not involved in the study, also emphasized that caring relationships are crucial for mental well-being.The California-based expert told Fox News Digital, [Its] little surprise that this study found that moms who had their own mothers living close by were less likely to be depressed,LOVE FROM WITHIN: 5 EASY WAYS TO CREATE FULFILLING LOVE WITHOUT DATING APPS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTSWhen living near family isnt possible, daily video calls with grandparents could be a good alternative, Borba suggested.Grandmothers can also find support networks for their daughters — friends and relatives as well as nearby medical resources, she said.The key is that the caregiver consistently reaches out in a caring, concerned manner to help the mother’s personal well-being as well as their children’s.This child-parent relationship can be instrumental in helping to ease the transition to motherhood, which can be jarring for some new moms, according to Lundquist.NAVY WIFE SURPRISES HUSBAND WITH NEWBORN GIRL DURING AIRPORT REUNION: ‘IT WAS MAGIC IN HIS EYES’There is an enormous intensity in realizing how much of yourself you have to give to someone else, said the therapist.And that’s physically, spiritually, energetically and emotionally, he said.If someone has a close relationship with their own parents, particularly their mom, thats a space where they can talk about those feelings.While single mothers seem to appreciate the support from their parents a little more, Lundquist said that for some families, its important to define the grandparents roles.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERIt seems evident that the grandparents are showing up with good intent, though they may not be as careful or nuanced in their approach as possible, he said.Lundquist suggested that grandparents offer their help rather than assuming they’re invited to visit or stay with their children and grandchildren.He encouraged grandparents to ask, What are some ways that we can be helpful but not feel like were imposing on you?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI think that has the effect of helping new moms or new parents feel more open to accepting help.

Aner Shapira, 22, along with 29 other young people in a tiny roadside bomb shelter as Hamas terrorists stormed the Supernova music festival in southern Israel.At dawn, rockets went off and armed terrorists descended upon the Negev desert from motorized paragliders.They raped women and massacred some 1,200 people in Israel that day, including 367 of the over 3,000 people who attended the festival.MOTHER OF AMERICAN HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS ASKS FOR GLOBAL SUPPORT TO MARK 100 DAYS OF CAPTIVITYGoldberg-Polin sent his mother, Rachel Goldberg, two text messages that morning. One said, I love you, and the other said, I’m sorry.Goldberg told Fox News Digital in a phone interview recently, He was just starting his life. We pray to God hes going to come home.Its her faith thats kept her going through the hardest of times, she revealed in a sometimes emotional interview.‘A different universeGoldberg and her husband live in Israel (they were both born and raised in Chicago). They have three children — their son Hersh was born in California. The family moved to Israel when he was nearly eight years old.Shed seen her son in Jerusalem the night before the act of terrorism, at a Shabbat dinner after synagogue, Goldberg recounted.Around 11 p.m., he kissed me, and he kissed my husband, and he said, ‘Love you guys. See you tomorrow.’She learned the grim details of what happened to her son and his friend from four survivors who were trapped beneath dead bodies in the same bomb shelter as her son.When the terrorists threw hand grenades into the shelter, Shapira heroically threw seven of them back out. But the eighth exploded in his hands — killing him.More grenades were tossed into the shelter and gunfire went off. Eighteen people were murdered in that rampage alone.Terrorists wielding machine guns then ordered Hersh Goldberg-Polin and two other wounded young men into a pickup truck outside.He was not screaming. He was obviously in shock.When Goldberg-Polin stood up, survivors reported seeing that his left arm had been blown off from the elbow down.FAR-LEFT HATRED OF JEWS TODAY ECHOES THE SOCIALISM AND ANTISEMITISM OF HITLER IN THE 1930SRachel Goldberg and her husband, Jon Polin, later saw video footage from the festival of their son getting into the truck.Goldberg told Fox News Digital, He was not screaming. He was obviously in shock. You can see that his arm is blown off … He tied some sort of bandage, with a T-shirt or something around it. He gets himself onto the truck by himself, and when he turns to sit down you can see the stump where his arm used to be.The distraught mother added, We have been living in a different universe since.The last cellphone signal from her sons phone was at 10:25 a.m. that Saturday, she said.‘Hope is mandatory’Hersh Goldberg-Polin is one of over 240 people who were abducted by Hamas, 45 of them were taken from the music festival.It is believed that as of right now, over 130 hostages are still being held in Gaza. The youngest is apparently a one-year-old baby.CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: ‘BRING THEM HOME NOW’ SAYS IT WONT REST UNTIL ALL ARE SAFELY RETURNEDRachel Goldberg is modern Orthodox. She credits her faith and her relationship with God for helping her persevere through the emotional pain, fear and uncertainty she is experiencing.God has faith in us, and gives us another chance to have another day to [create] meaning in our lives.When you’re a believer, hope is mandatory, she said.She recites the Modeh Ani prayer upon awakening to show her gratitude to God, she told Fox News Digital.Its a one-line prayer that just says, ‘Thank you for giving my life back to me, for returning my soul to me, and for having faith in me.’She added, I love that idea that God has faith in us, and gives us another chance to have another day to [create] meaning in our lives.The devoted mom reads psalms throughout the day, which she said strengthens her.I think of Psalms as a self-help book, because you can pick whichever one speaks to you in that moment.I think of Psalms as a self-help book, because you can pick whichever one speaks to you in that moment, she said.WOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES FAMILY MEMBERS IN NEW YORK CITYSome of the psalms are saying, ‘Hallelujah, youre amazing,’ and some of them are saying, ‘Im at the bottom of a pit. Where are you? Why are you hiding your face from me? Help me, help me!’Psalm 23 reminds her that God is with her, she said. Even though I’m going through the shadow of scary things, I know that youre with me, she said. Its a really great tool for people who are in the midst of something really difficult.She also summarized Psalm 121 as, I’m calling out to you from the depths.After Oct. 7, she said she has been reading a psalm each day that corresponds with the number of days her son has been held hostage.‘Don’t need two arms to travelRachel Goldbergs voice both lifted and broke as she spoke about her son to Fox News Digital.She described his humor as sarcastic without being mean, and said he always adhered to the commandment of being respectful toward his parents.Hes a voracious reader who loves music, playing soccer and camping, she said.Since the age of 15, hes been active in Hapoel Jerusalem, an organization that hosts youth coexistence activities, such as soccer games featuring Jewish and Arab kids playing together.When he was in first grade, her son asked for his subscription to National Geographic Kids to be upgraded to the regular National Geographic, she said.JEWISH STUDENTS AT GEORGETOWN LAW FEAR VIOLENCE AMID HEATED RHETORIC FROM CLASSMATES AND ANTI-ISRAELI GROUPSAlways curious about exploring different places, he traveled to six European countries for nine weeks by himself last summer, attending music festivals and meeting people from all over the world.He was planning to travel for at least another year when he was abducted, said his mother.Freeing the captives is the most important mitzvah (commandment), according to Jewish tradition, said Goldberg.She said she prays that hell get the help that he needs, that hell get the new arm that he needs — and that he will take that trip around the world, because you dont need two arms to travel, she added.Goldberg believes the hostage situation in Gaza is a global humanitarian crisis, she said, and that freeing the captives is the most important mitzvah (commandment), according to Jewish tradition.She said that even if it’s scary to get involved, theres a moment in everyones life where its time to stand up and be brave … In a crisis, thats when really who you are comes out, and its when who you are will be remembered.She and her husband came up with the idea of an educational initiative to advocate for the hostages in Gaza, and to raise awareness about how freedom from captivity is a basic universal human right for every innocent person around the globe.Everyone CountsJewish educational organizations, M²: The Institute for Experiential Jewish Education, and Kol HaOt — in partnership with The Jewish Education Project — brought this idea to life by launching the website Everyone Counts on Jan. 14, 2024 — which marked 100 days of captivity for the hostages.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTERThe day after the site launched was Martin Luther King Jr. Day — and the Everyone Counts site displayed his quotes noting staunch support for Israel, democracy, freedom and peace that people could publicize.Photos of The Abducted Hearts exhibit in Ness Ziona, Israel, show life-size black iron silhouettes of the hostages with empty hearts cut out, illustrating the harrowing emotional effects of their captivity.The Everyone Counts site also links to other sites such as Listen to Moms — which offers support for mothers from 25 different countries who have been advocating for the release of the infants and children abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThere are simple steps listed on the website that people can follow, such as taking one minute a day to contact their members of Congress, or wearing a yellow ribbon, a symbol of hope for freedom for the hostages.The display of this symbol in public signals to the families of hostages that their loved ones have not been forgotten.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPEvery act of advocacy can be dedicated to a particular hostage, the site also notes.No’a Gorlin, COO at M², stated, Everyone Counts is about knowing the people, and knowing each person — it’s not just some story out there.

They were trying to hold on to the walls of the hole, so it would not collapse further. The fire department said it used support boards to keep more sand from collapsing in as they used shovels to dig the children out.Sloan was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital, while the boy was in stable condition.The girl’s mother, Therese, said via a GoFundMe post that her daughter died in a freak accident while on vacation.It took away our greatest 7.5 years. Don’t tell us you’re sorry for our loss…don’t do that to us. We experienced the purest human being and we are forever changed by her, Therese wrote.We love you beyond any stretch of the imagination. Our sweet Sloan. What we would give.One expert says that the tragedy could have been averted if the beach was staffed with lifeguards who are trained to warn people of potential hazards.This doesn’t happen on guarded beaches, Jim McCrady, a surf rescue chief in Hallandale Beach told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. McCrady is also vice president and Lifesaving Academies director for the U.S. Lifesaving Association Southeast Region.We do that all day long. We spot hazards, and then we mitigate the dangers involved in those hazards. This is a daily thing that happens on a guarded beach, when someone starts to dig a hole. We not only tell the person not to dig a deep hole, but to fill it in before they leave.NEW JERSEY BEACH SAND COLLAPSE: FIREFIGHTER DESCRIBES EFFORTS TO UNCOVER VICTIMSIn other nearby coastal towns, lifeguards are instructed to tell beachgoers about the risks of digging in the sand and to stop people from digging any deeper than about 2 feet, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, a town in Broward County about 33 miles north of Miami, does not currently staff any of its beaches with lifeguards, the publication reports.Pompano Beach Fire Rescue provides fire and ocean rescue services to the town and responded to Tuesdays incident.Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Mayor Chris Vincent said that the town commission had been considering hiring lifeguard services for its beaches this year.It’s unfortunate, maybe, we didn’t have it now, he told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. I’m not sure that would’ve saved the child’s life. I don’t want to hypothesize whether lifeguards at that time, there would’ve been a chance, I don’t know that, I don’t think anybody knows that.Henri Jean, a geological engineer, explained to Fox 13 Tampa Bay why the depth of the hole was so dangerous.For every foot you go down into the ground, you put 110 pounds per square foot of depth, so at five feet deep the amount of soil that would be on top of you would be about 550 pounds per square feet, Jean said.The combination of the weight and the lack of oxygen would result in a very bad situation for anybody down there.He said for the hole the siblings were digging to be deemed safe, it would have to be laid back with a safe slope 10 to 20 feet across at the top.Jean said that without a safe width at the top, a deep hole can quickly become very vertical and therefore, very dangerous. It is not clear how long Sloan was trapped beneath the sand.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe first thing that you can probably take from this is to never dig anything deep enough to get your head in it, Jean said.In 2022, 18-year-old Levi Caverly died when a 10-foot hole he dug with his sister on a New Jersey beach collapsed.Meanwhile, McCrady also told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that it is possible to die even if ones head is exposed, as the weight of the sand can make it too difficult for a persons lungs to expand.Additionally, the sand can pin one’s arms to their sides, making it impossible for them to pull themselves out.
288;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/todays-mortgage-rates-february-23-2024;Todays mortgage rates plummet for 30-year terms | February 23, 2024;Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as Credible below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.625%% as of February 22, which is 0.375 percentage points lower than yesterday.With mortgage rates changing daily, it’s a good idea to check today’s rate before applying for a loan. It’s also important to compare different lenders’ current interest rates, terms, and fees to ensure you get the best deal.Rates last updated on February 22, 2024. Rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).How do mortgage rates work?When you take out a mortgage loan to purchase a home, you’re borrowing money from a lender. In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your credit score , debt-to-income ratio (DTI), down payment , loan amount, and repayment term.After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an amortization schedule , which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand, and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.What determines the mortgage rate?Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income, and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:Location of the homePrice of the homeYour credit score and credit historyLoan termLoan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)Down payment amountLoan-to-value (LTV) ratioDTIOther indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:Current economic conditionsRate of inflationMarket conditionsHousing construction supply, demand, and costsConsumer spendingStock market10-year Treasury yieldsFederal Reserve policiesCurrent employment rateHow to compare mortgage ratesAlong with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:Shop around for lenders: Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees.

Consider a mortgage rate lock: A mortgage rate lock lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing.A lets you lock in the current mortgage rate for a certain amount of time — often between 30 and 90 days. During this time, you can continue shopping around for a home without worrying about the rate changing. Choose between an adjustable- and fixed-rate mortgage: The interest rate type can affect how much you pay over time, so consider your options carefully.One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:15-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.29%6.29% Monthly payment: $2,579$2,579 Total interest charges: $164,186$164,186 Total loan amount: $464,18630-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.89%6.89% Monthly payment: $1,974$1,974 Total interest charges: $410,566$410,566 Total loan amount: $710,565Pros and cons of mortgagesIf you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:Predictable monthly payments: Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan.

This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company. Review any assets: Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts. Know your DTI: Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds. Check your credit score: To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment. Know the property type: During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property. Choose the loan type: Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, VA loans , USDA loans , FHA loans , and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs. Prepare for upfront and closing costs: Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.How to apply for a mortgageHere are the basic steps to apply for a mortgage, and what you can typically expect during the process:Choose a lender : Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits. Get pre-approved: Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts. Submit a formal application: Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents. Wait for the lender to process your loan: It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays. Complete the closing process: If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.How to refinance a mortgageRefinancing your mortgage lets you trade your current loan for a new one. It does not mean taking out a second loan. You will also still be responsible for making payments on the refinanced loan.You might want to refinance your mortgage if you:Want a lower interest rate or different rate typeAre looking for a shorter repayment term so you can pay off the loan soonerNeed a smaller monthly paymentWant to remove the PMI from your loanNeed to use the equity for things like home improvement or debt consolidation (cash-out refinancing)The refinancing process is similar to the process you follow for the original loan. Here are the basic steps:Choose the type of refinancing you want.Compare lenders for the best rates.Complete the application process.Wait for the lender to review your application.Provide supporting documentation (if requested).Complete the home appraisal.Proceed to closing, review the loan documents, and pay any closing costs.FAQWhat is a rate lock?Interest rates on mortgages fluctuate all the time, but a rate lock allows you to lock in your current rate for a set amount of time. This ensures you get the rate you want as you complete the homebuying process .What are mortgage points?Mortgage points are a type of prepaid interest that you can pay upfront — often as part of your closing costs — for a lower overall interest rate. This can lower your APR and monthly payments.What are closing costs?Closing costs are the fees you, as the buyer, need to pay before getting a loan. Common fees include attorney fees, home appraisal fees, origination fees , and application fees.If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credibles free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.

291;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/exploring-oscar-nominated-jack-fisks-legendary-production-designs;Exploring Oscar-nominated Jack Fisks legendary production designs: I like to build;Jack Fisk, the legendary production designer, has been down a lot of roads in his life. He goes looking down back roads for movie locations and hillsides on which to plop down mock houses. He’s been to the Solomon Islands for The Thin Red Line and the Canadian Rockies for The Revenant. But America, really, is his territory.Fisk, 78, has for half a century been building some of the most indelible homes and structures of movies. He crafted the grand Victorian that peers down from above the wheat fields in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978). He erected the oil derrick of Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood (2007). And he built Mollie Burkhardts Osage home for Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon.Killers of the Flower Moon, which entailed recreating the circa-1919 Oklahoma town of Fairfax, expands the wide swath of American ground, and history, that Fisk has covered. And it’s earned Fisk his third Oscar nomination, a capstone to a career crafting rough-hewn on-screen worlds with such fine-grained dimensionality that you feel as though you walked through them.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON NAMED BEST FILM OF THE YEAR BY NY CRITICS GROUPThat’s partly because you — or at least the actors — actually could. Though much set design is done piecemeal, with a few facades just for the camera, Fisk prefers to build entire houses on location to give filmmakers and actors the ability to cross in and out of them. To see out the windows.We build everything so it can be shot from 360 degrees, Fisk said in a recent interview from his home, a 210-acre horse farm where he and his wife, Sissy Spacek, live in Albemarle County, Virginia. And directors take advantage of it. I love not narrowing down their options too early. They can move. And when the actors get involved, it’s much more organic.It’s something I’ve always liked to do just because I like to build, Fisk added, smiling.In winter, work around their house in Virginia had slowed, though Fisk had spent that morning tiling a bathroom for his daughter. Work on the house moves at a crawl, he says, compared to on set. On There Will Be Blood, he had some 50 carpenters nailing away. When you do it yourself, everything slows down to molasses, he says.Fisk first set out as a painter and sculptor. He attended art school and initially came to Hollywood only with an idea of painting billboards. After latching onto film-making, he’s helped designed all kinds of movies. Carrie (1976). Eraserhead (1977). Mulholland Drive (2001). He’s worked on nearly every Malick movie. But what he’s best known for are his homes.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhere are you going to put all these sculptures? You’re going to lug ‘em around or put ’em in a storage area, Fisk says. When I got involved in films, it was so exciting because I would build it and then they would film it. So there was a record of it. I was just as happy to never see it again. It always looks better when they filmed it. The lighting is there, the set dressing is there, the actors are performing in it. So you’re remembering it in the best possible light. Now, I build my sculptures to look like houses.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.The state of Florida is set to crack down on life in the fast lane.The Florida legislature has passed a bill that would ban motorists from cruising in the left lane of highways, sending it to Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature. The bill passed unanimously in the state Senate 37-0.If someone in the left lane is going slower, and you pass them (on the right), you are creating an infraction, and you can get ticketed, bill sponsor state Sen. Keith Perry (R) said Thursday, according to The News Service of Florida.Under HB 317, drivers on a road, street or highway with two or more lanes where the speed limit is at least 65 miles per hour … may not operate a motor vehicle in the furthermost left-hand lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle, when preparing to exit … or when otherwise directed by an official traffic control device.TRAGIC FLORIDA SAND HOLE DEATH COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED: EXPERTThe restriction would not apply to high occupancy lanes.The legislation was sponsored by Republican state Reps. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Melony Bell in the House and Perry in the Senate.FLORIDA PAIR CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER SEX-FOR-HIRE CAR THEFT PLOT WENT AWRY: DEPUTIESAnyone found to be in violation of the law would face fines for a moving violation, with fines up to $158, according to the bill text.There is an exception for authorized emergency vehicles and vehicles engaged in highway maintenance or construction operations.FLORIDA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CONFIRMS 6TH CASE OF MEASLES AMID OUTBREAKPerry said the measure is intended to improve highway safety. Last year we had 247 instances where people were either incapacitated or deaths that happened from improper passing on the right-hand side on someone’s blindside, he told Action News Jax last week.Should DeSantis sign the bill, Florida would join eight other states where it is currently illegal to drive in the left lane except for turning left or passing, according to AutoInsurance.org. States with those restrictions include Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and West Virginia.Driving is a pretty uniform practice across the United States, so most of us dont think twice before crossing new state lines. However, many states have their own traffic laws that pose legal penalties and physical dangers if not obeyed, said Jeffrey Johnson, an insurance lawyer.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPVehicles in the left-lane can cause dangerous situations for other drivers when they move slower than the flow of traffic. A driver that attempts to pass someone on the right-hand side risks causing an accident by moving through the slower left-lane drivers blind spot.For that reason, 27 states require drivers to stay right if they are moving slower than the cars surrounding them.
293;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-caused-years-neglect-oversight-failures-investigators-say;Pittsburgh bridge collapse caused by years of neglect and oversight failures, investigators say;The collapse of the Forbes Avenue bridge in Pittsburgh resulted from inadequate maintenance and repair by the city, federal investigators say.The collapse occurred on Jan. 28, 2022, involving a bus and four cars.The city of Pittsburgh allegedly failed to act on maintenance recommendations for over 15 years leading up to the collapse.The city of Pittsburgh did not adequately maintain or repair a bridge and failed to act on inspection reports, leading to the corrosion of the structures steel legs and its collapse into a ravine, federal investigators said Wednesday.The city-owned Forbes Avenue bridge fell down on Jan. 28, 2022, plunging a bus and four cars about 100 feet into the Fern Hollow Creek. Another vehicle drove off the east bridge abutment and landed on its roof. There were injuries but no one died.After investigators presented their findings, three members of the National Transportation Safety Board agreed that poor inspections and insufficient oversight were among the probable causes of the collapse.PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE SPARKS CALLS TO EXAMINE MORE THAN 10K SIMILAR BRIDGESThe Fern Hollow Bridge collapse should never have happened, NTSB chair Jennifer L. Homendy said, describing the incident as a wake-up call.Homendy cited extensive corrosion to the uncoated weathering steel and repeated failures to act on damage to the bridge that was known for years. In some areas, the steel had deteriorated to the point of visible holes in the structure.The city of Pittsburgh was responsible for inspecting and maintaining the Fern Hollow bridge, said NTSB senior structural engineer Dan Walsh. Similar maintenance and repair recommendations were made in the inspection reports for more than 15 years leading up to the collapse. But the city failed to act on them, resulting in progressive corrosion to the point of failure.INVESTIGATORS IN 2022 PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE LOOKING AT DAMAGES TO THE LEGS OF THE STRUCTUREThe office of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said the administration does not dispute the NTSB findings and noted the bridge inspections were performed by consultants. The city has created a new Bridge Maintenance Division and increased funding for bridge maintenance and repairs by 300%.Pittsburgh communications director Maria Montaño said in an email that the city has since examined inspection reports for all the bridges it owns and has been working diligently to address all critical tasks identified in those reports. She said most high priority tasks have been resolved or are in the process, and the city has reviewed all of its bridges fracture critical components and made sure they are draining properly.Four people were injured, two of them severely, when the bridge collapsed just hours before President Joe Biden arrived in Pittsburgh to promote spending on infrastructure.Attorney Steve Barth, who represents bus driver Daryl Luciani in litigation against the city and engineers involved with the bridge, said the NTSB findings confirmed what his own experts had concluded.Barth said there were multiple levels of failure, from data collection, recording that data, implementation of any recommendations and then oversight.There are at least six lawsuits involving the bridge collapse, Barth said. Luciani needed shoulder surgery, had back and neck injuries and is dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, Barth said. The accident required Luciani to be out on worker’s compensation for a lengthy period, his lawyer said.Montaño declined to comment on the pending litigation.The presentations expanded on findings released by the NTSB last May, when investigators said drainage problems led to the deterioration of the structures legs and that debris, dirt and leaves had not been cleared.The old bridge was about 50 years old when it collapsed and had been under a 26-ton (24,000 kilograms) posted weight limit, with annual inspections required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since 2014. Investigators said a more accurate inspection would have reduced that to about 6,000 pounds, which may have required its closure.The board played an animation of the collapse along with video from the bus, operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, now known as Pittsburgh Regional Transit. It showed the harrowing moments when the bridge began to fail and then dropped.BIDEN SKEWERED FOR CLAIMING HE WITNESSED A PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE: ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER LIEThe failure began when a steel tie-plate on the bridges southwestern leg gave way because of corrosion and structural loss, said NTSB senior accident investigator Dennis Collins. The city also made improper load calculations, in part because paving records did not show the asphalt was twice as thick as inspectors believed, he said.The citys bridge inspection program did not identify all of the structures essential fracture critical sections that would require closer monitoring, Collins said.Steel cables were added to shore up the bridge in 2009, but they were intended as a temporary solution and a long-term fix was not completed.A new bridge at the site 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of downtown Pittsburgh opened to traffic in December 2022.

Thank you to my colleagues for adopting my legislation prohibiting turns at red lights in central Atlanta! Councilman Jason Dozier said. Pedestrian safety and quality of life go hand in hand, and Im deeply proud of our work to make our streets safer for our most vulnerable people.The ordinance will ban right turns at red lights in Downtown Atlanta, Midtown Atlanta and the Castleberry Hill community. It will take effect at the beginning of 2026 to allow time for the citys Department of Transportation to put up signage at the affected intersections.ATLANTA OFFICIALS CONSIDERING BANNING RIGHT TURNS ON REDSupporters on the city council said the neighborhoods where right on red is now banned are home to cultural attractions, businesses and homes that bring in heavy pedestrian traffic.Officials argue the measure will make these neighborhoods safer for pedestrians and foster a sense of community, encourage social interaction, and support local businesses, therefore contributing to the overall quality of life.Dozier, who co-sponsored the legislation, previously told Fox News Digital that he proposed the ordinance because Atlanta has seen a significant rise in pedestrian injuries and fatalities due to car collisions.Weve seen a 50% increase in pedestrian deaths since 2020, and 38 pedestrians died on Atlantas streets last year as a consequence, Dozier said in an emailed statement. When cars are allowed to turn at red lights, they typically creep into crosswalks, with drivers looking only for oncoming cars rather than pedestrians or cyclists. Even worse, vehicle sizes have ballooned over the last 20 years, so even if a driver were looking for a pedestrian, bigger blind spots and narrower sight lines make it difficult to see them. Crosswalks represent some of the very little space that our cities afford pedestrians, and this legislation attempts to protect that space.TSA DIRECTOR ARRESTED BY US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTIONPropel ATL, an organization that wants to reclaim Atlantas streets for pedestrians and bicyclists, said many residents support the change.Turning right on red poses significant risks to the most vulnerable...people in wheelchairs, seniors, and people on bikes and scooters, Propel ATL Executive Director Rebecca Serna said at a January meeting, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.Opponents of the ban have raised concerns over the more than $100,000 needed to install signs at the impacted red lights and said the project will divert Department of Transportation resources from other more important projects.However, supporters say that if the red light ban is successful, it can be expanded to other parts of the city, per FOX 5 Atlanta.GEORGIA REPUBLICANS TARGET ATLANTA SQUATTERS WITH HARD-HITTING BILL: ‘NO MORE FREE RIDES’A dramatic rise in accidents killing or injuring pedestrians and bicyclists has pushed several U.S. cities to consider bans on turning right on red.The Washington, D.C. City Council in 2023 approved a right on red ban that will take effect in 2025.New Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s transition plan called for restricting right turns on red, but his administration hasn’t provided specifics.The college town of Ann Arbor, Michigan, now prohibits right turns at red lights in the downtown area.San Francisco leaders recently voted to urge their transportation agency to ban right on red across the city, and other major cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver have looked into bans as well.New York City has a longstanding prohibition on right turns at red lights, with large signs notifying drivers that they may not do the commonplace maneuver while in Manhattan.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere is no recent research on how many people nationwide are hurt or killed by right-turning drivers.Advocates for the bans and critics have pointed to a 1994 report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to Congress that analyzed four years of crash data from Indiana, Maryland and Missouri and three years of data from Illinois. The report counted 558 injury crashes and four fatalities caused by right turns on red.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
296;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/collapse-gold-mine-venezuela-underscores-dangers-poorly-regulated-industry;The collapse of a gold mine in Venezuela underscores the dangers of a poorly regulated industry;LA PARAGUA, Venezuela (AP) — Osvaldo Romero and his wife got off a battered boat Friday under the scorching sun of central Venezuela and walked up the bank of a river barefoot, their pants soaking wet and eyes showing the shock of having faced days earlier one of the country’s deadliest mining disasters.He carried a few belongings they had wrapped with plastic and rope, and as residents of the community of La Paragua approached him, he said he regretted having worked at the remote mine where greed and callousness were king and queen.VENEZUELA REPORTEDLY SCRAPS US DEAL TO DEPORT ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AS SOME COMMIT CRIMES TO BE DEPORTEDThat is the worst mine I have ever worked in, said Romero, who has been a miner for 10 years. He had been working at the collapsed Bulla Loca mine until Thursday, when he and his wife, without any money or gold to show for their hard work since January, hopped on the boat.They were removing the injured from the rubble, and they were still taking gold out. That’s unconscionable, he said.The collapse of the open-pit gold mine that killed at least 16 people has underscored the dangers of working in a poorly regulated industry. But it has also shown the crucial role that mining plays in the survival of thousands of people who take a gamble and create quasi-cities, complete with bingo and raffles, around mines in hopes of earning what other parts of the troubled country cannot give them.Venezuela’s government does not have an accurate count of people who were living at the site of the mine, but several miners who have worked there estimate that at least 3,000 people, including children, were in Bulla Loca at any given time since December. On Thursday, several privately operated boats arrived in La Paragua with people who had given up on their dreams of gold. Among them was a 2-week-old baby boy who was born at the mine.The community that formed around the mine includes clothing stores, restaurants, convenience stores and an evangelical church all built out of wood and tarps. Some stores also sell metered WiFi.Businesses organize bingo nights with televisions and loudspeakers as on-site prizes as well as raffles with motorcycles and cars as grand prizes that must be picked up in La Paragua. Alcohol though is banned.Food and other items are priced in gold and so are transportation costs to and from the mine. After Tuesday’s disaster, some boat operators were charging 2 grams of gold per person each way. That’s about $80, given the lower quality of Bulla Loca’s gold compared to that of other Venezuelan mines.Some of those returning to La Paragua Thursday brought back 2-liter soda bottles, bags of rice and flour and canned goods. They also brought back the shovels they used at work. Without tiny pieces of gold in their pockets, some lined up under a military tent where volunteers with a local church handed out oatmeal and cachitos, a Venezuelan savory pastry.We left out of fear and brought back nothing. Nothing, Dairely Ruiz said. We haven’t even eaten since yesterday.As Ruiz and others continued to arrive, Angel Marcano, the governor of the state of Bolivar, where the mine is located, said the number of deaths in the tragedy remained at 16, which miners and area residents consider an undercount in part because Indigenous people who lost relatives in the collapse are retrieving their bodies and burying them in their remote communities without notifying the government.Manuel Tirado, an Indigenous man of the Colibrí community, told The Associated Press he lost his son and son-in-law in the collapse. Neither was taken to a morgue or buried in the cemetery in La Paragua.I took him out of the mine and buried him in my community, Tirado said of his son Reynaldo.Venezuela’s government in 2016 established a huge mining development zone stretching across the central area of the country to supplement flagging revenue from its dominant oil industry, which has seen production decline to near its lowest levels in decades as a result of mismanagement, corruption and, more recently, U.S. sanctions.Since then, mining operations for gold, diamonds, copper and other minerals have proliferated. Many are wildcat mines, operating on the margins of the law.Despite brutal conditions and the presence of criminal gangs, ordinary Venezuelans continue to flock to mining centers in hopes of getting rich quick and escaping crushing poverty.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs he walked away from the river, Romero said he will have to sell the motorcycle and car he kept in La Paragua while he worked away to recover his losses from his two moths in Bulla Loca.But I have to thank God because I am walking even if it’s barefoot, Romero said.

The book was never published, as Azoff claimed both Eagles co-founders Don Henley and the late Glenn Frey were unhappy with Sanders emphasis on the band’s split in the early 80s.Azoff, a longtime music industry titan, admitted that Henley and Frey disliked the books direction, and that for me personally, all the stuff about the Eagles breakup was unacceptable, according to The Associated Press.Henley is expected to take the stand and testify against Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski, who were charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree for allegedly attempting to sell manuscripts, including developmental lyrics to the Eagles song Hotel California, according to the original indictment filed by the New York District Attorneys Office in 2022.EAGLES HOTEL CALIFORNIA’ CRIMINAL TRIAL OVER STOLEN LYRIC PAGES IS ‘ABOUT THE NAMES INVOLVED: ‘A GOLD MINE’The manuscripts are collectively valued at over $1 million, according to the district attorney.Defense lawyers claim Henley gave away the documents.They have accused three innocent men of a crime that never occurred, Inciardi’s lawyer, Stacey Richman, told Judge Curtis Farber during opening statements.All these lyrics are very personal to him, they’re a part of musical history, and it was simply unacceptable to him that they be stolen by anyone else, Azoff testified according to the AP. He admitted that he had never known Henley to give away any of his work, including most of the lyrics he created with Frey.3 CHARGED WITH HAVING EAGLES DON HENLEYS STOLEN HANDWRITTEN NOTES AFTER ROCK LEGEND HIMSELF GOT INVOLVED: DAWhen the biography didnt come to fruition by 1982, Azoff remembered Sanders requesting a substantial amount of money, and said Sanders had behaved with great reserve by not giving the story about the Eagles split to a magazine.He had inside knowledge, Azoff said, adding that Frey and Henley didn’t want some ugly story of the breakup of the Eagles to be published as they were both pursuing solo careers. They ended up paying Sanders roughly $75,000 so that he could find a new publisher. Sanders later sold the handwritten work to Horowitz, a rare-book dealer, for $50,000.Horowitz then sold pages to Inciardi, a former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator, and memorabilia collector Kosinski. Inciardi and Kosinski attempted to sell pages of the lyrics through Kosinskis company, Gotta Have Rock and Roll, but were caught by Henley in 2012.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Shortly after, Inciardi sent a similar email notifying the auction house that developmental lyrics for Life in the Fast Lane were also available for sale.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERWhen Don Henley learned that Inciardi and Kosinski were trying to sell portions of the manuscripts, he filed police reports, told the defendants that the materials were stolen, and demanded the return of his property, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg Jr. said in a statement released with the charges in 2022.Rather than making any effort to ensure they actually had rightful ownership, the defendants responded by engaging in a years-long campaign to prevent Henley from recovering the manuscripts.Throughout 2015, Kosinski and Inciardi continued their attempts to sell 13 pages of developmental lyrics. In December 2016, the DA’s office executed search warrants and retrieved Henley’s stolen manuscripts from both Sotheby’s and Kosinskis New Jersey residence, according to the DA.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShortly thereafter, Horowitz attempted to exploit the recent death of founding Eagles member Glenn Frey to prevent criminal prosecution, he produced a new false statement of provenance, this time claiming that the materials originated from the now-deceased Frey, the DA shared in a statement. In one email message, Horowitz observed that ‘[Frey] alas, is dead and identifying him as the source would make this go away once and for all.’Representatives for Horowitz, Inciardi, Kosinski and Henley did not immediately respond to Fox News Digitals request for comment.

303;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/lucky-new-years-foods-around-world;10 lucky New Years foods from around the world;For many of us, a traditional New Years feast is comprised of Champagne and whatever confetti happens to fall into it while were drinking it.But for lots of revelers around the world, New Years is a time to eat symbolic (and perhaps more substantial) treats and meals.Cultures from nearly every continent celebrate the New Year with their own unique foods — many of which are eaten in the hopes of bringing luck, good health or prosperity in the near future.WHY DOES FRUITCAKE LAST SO LONG? INGREDIENTS AND PREPARATION OF THE DESSERT PLAY INTO ITS LONGEVITYSo if youre looking for a fun way to ring in the New Year that wont result in a pounding headache or confetti in your teeth, try one of the worldly delights noted below.Diving right in here.The Netherlands: OliebollenOn New Years Eve in the Netherlands, the Dutch traditionally prepare and eat oliebollen, or small doughnuts studded with dried raisins or currants.The tradition of eating oliebollen (literally oil balls) is thought to have originated with early Germanic tribes as a way to ward off the pagan goddess Perchta, who would fly through the skies during Yule and slice open the bellies of disobedient tribespeople.Anyone who had eaten oliebollen, however, was spared, as Perchtas sword would slide off their full, greasy bellies.SAY GOODBYE TO THESE HABITS HOLDING YOU BACK IN 2023Spain: 12 grapesLots of people sip some bubbly to welcome in the New Year, but in Spain (and in some parts of Latin America) theyll be gulping down the grapes themselves.The tradition of eating 12 grapes at midnight began in the 1880s as a way of copying the French tradition of having grapes and Champagne on the last day of the year, noted NPR. This custom was ultimately adopted by Madrileños, or inhabitants of Madrid, who would travel to Puerta del Sol to see the bells chime at the turning of the year and, most likely in an ironic or mocking manner, eat grapes like the upper class, the outlet said.Today, this method still lives on, and residents can even purchase their 12 grapes in small tins, already seeded and peeled.(Its also sometimes said that the grapes must be eaten within the first 12 seconds of the New Year to welcome 12 lucky months.)If luck in love is what you are looking for, its said that eating your grapes under a table could do the trick.Italy: Cotechino con LenticchieItalians know a thing or two about preparing a feast, so it only makes sense that theyd whip up a mouthwatering cotechino con lenticchie for New Years.This traditional stew is made with pork and lentils, which have been described as two of Italy’s culinary symbols of good luck.For example, some Italians believe that pigs, who push their snouts forward along the way rather than backward, are symbolic of progress. As for lentils, they’re already shaped like miniature coins, symbolizing fortune. Therefore, eating this hearty dish on New Years is said to ensure a prosperous 12 months.Berlin: Berliner PfannkuchenIn Berlin, different varieties of jelly doughnuts known as Berliner Pfannkuchen are purchased at local bakeries on Dec. 31 and enjoyed later in the evening.Some folks even eat these fluffy treats to nurse [a] hangover the next day, said The New York Times.NEW YEARS QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THESE FACTS ABOUT RINGING IN A NEW YEAR?And while the Berliner Pfannkuchen is usually filled with a fruit jam, like plum, apricot or raspberry, be warned: Its a common practical joke to fill some with mustard instead of jelly to trick unsuspecting guests, said History.com.Greece: VasilopitaWhen it comes to celebrating New Year’s Eve like the Greeks, vasilopita is the dessert you should have on the table.A piece is cut for each family member. If the coin is in your piece, you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.Greek American nutritionist Elena Paravantes describes this dish as a moist cake made with traditional ingredients like sugar, milk, eggs, and even orange and orange zest, although it can also be made with yeast for a more bread-like consistency.Vasilopita is the Greek lucky New Year’s cake that has a coin hidden in it and is cut at midnight, said Paravantes. A piece is cut for each family member. If the coin is in your piece, you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.Many vasilopitas are decorated with the date of the New Year, but they can also be topped with sliced almonds or a simple dusting of powdered sugar.Also in Greece, pomegranates have been a symbol of good luck, specifically when it comes to fertility. Often in the country, pomegranates are not consumed, but rather smashed on the ground for a stroke of good luck.If you don’t want to smash a pomegranate, there are plenty of dishes featuring the fruit you can whip together for extra luck this New Year. One idea is a yummy pomegranate-based drink, alcoholic or otherwise.In addition to pomegranates, its Greek tradition to hang onions on doors as a sign of rebirth. If you want to add some onions to your New Year’s spread in honor of this tradition, french onion soup or crispy onion rings are a good way to do so.Japan: Toshikoshi SobaOn New Year’s Eve, the Japanese savor a bowl of hearty soba noodles known as toshikoshi soba, or year-passing noodles. The buckwheat noodles are longer than usual because the soba symbolizes longevity, reported The Chicago Tribune.THE HISTORY BEHIND THE NEW YEARS EVE BALL DROP CEREMONYAccording to some historians, soba is supposed to signify strength and resiliency, since the buckwheat plant itself bounces back even after being flattened by wind and rain, added The Japan Times, which also noted that the long noodles may signify the [eaters] wish for a long life.(And if theyre feeling superstitious, some diners avoid cutting the noodles while eating to ensure lasting luck. In other words, start slurping!)American South: Black-eyed peas, Hoppin JohnIts common to see black-eyed peas on the New Years table in many parts of the American South, often as an ingredient in Hoppin John (a Carolina dish of rice, peas and bits of pork).The theories behind these dishes differ, but according to cookbook author and New York Times contributor Jessica B. Harris, the African slaves en route to America survived on black-eyed peas, and later planted the hardy crops upon arriving, so having some extra on hand at the New Year guaranteed sustenance provided by a new crop.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERAnother theory suggests that black-eyed peas came to be considered lucky sometime after the Civil War, when Union soldiers ate the rest of the Southern crops but ignored the peas, allowing the locals to sustain themselves.Black-eyed peas are often served with collard greens and cornbread.Ireland: Buttered bread (and banging bread)Irish households would sometimes leave buttered bread (or bread and butter sandwiches) on their doorsteps on New Years Eve for local children to come and collect, according to historians.The holiday is sometimes called The Day of the Buttered Bread in Gaelic.Another tradition reportedly involves banging a stale loaf of Christmas bread against the doors and walls of the house to scare away any bad spirits.Mexico: TamalesOver in Mexico, tamales are a food often served on holidays, and New Year’s is no different. When tamales are put together, the steps to make them are typically split among multiple family members. This dish is a very family-oriented one that takes help from the whole family to make.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTamales are a fairly time-consuming dish, made up of a corn-based dough stuffed with meat and other toppings, and wrapped in corn husk, so you’ll need all hands on deck.Germany: Soft pretzelsA New Year’s feast in Germany will often feature soft pretzels.These pretzels are seen as a symbol of good luck, prosperity and spiritual fulfillment, said History.com.Sauerkraut, lentil soup and fondue are usually on the menu as well.Michael Bartiromo contributed reporting.
304;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxweather.com/earth-space/intuitive-machines-nasa-return-america-to-moon-landing;Watch live: NASA, Intuitive Machines provide update on Moon landing;NASA and Intuitive Machines are scheduled to provide an update at 5 p.m. ET Friday on the first American spacecraft to land on the Moon in more than a half-century. Watch the event live in the video player above.America returned to the Moon on Thursday with the Odysseus lander touching down near the unexplored region of the lunar South Pole.While about half of all lunar landings end in failure, Houston-based Intuitive Machines is the first private company to succeed, also marking the first U.S. Moon landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972. This was the first successful mission as part of NASAs Commercial Lunar Services Payload (CLPS) program. Another commercial lunar mission by Pittsburgh company Astrobotic failed to reach the Moon last month.The Nova-C lunar lander arrived near the Moon’s South Pole on Thursday at 6:23 p.m. ET. Flight controllers confirmed that Odysseus was upright and sending data two hours later, following communications troubleshooting.Odysseus is alive and well, Intuitive Machines said Friday morning on social media. Flight controllers are communicating and commanding the vehicle to download science data.The company said the lander has good telemetry and solar charging as they continue to learn more about the vehicle’s specific location and overall health.Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus will speak to the media at 5 p.m. ET Friday to discuss more on their historic moment.We can confirm without a doubt our equipment is on the surface of the Moon, Intuitive Machines Chief Technology Officer Tim Crain said.Intuitive Machines teams had to think on their feet as the landing approached.The lasers on the spacecraft needed for landing were not functioning but Intuitive Machines engineers opted to complete another orbit for landing and allow time to upload a patch reworking the landing system to use two lasers on NASA payloads.The quick thinking paid off.During its descent phase, the spacecraft guided itself to the landing area known as Malapert using the Terrain Relative Navigation camera from Redwire Space. The high-definition camera looked for a safe landing spot free of craters, boulders and other hazards. At 10 meters (about 33 feet), the spacecraft locked in on its landing site.The hazardous landing required Odysseus to slow from about 4,000 mph to a velocity of about 2 mph (1 meter per second) before touching down on the Moon.Odysseus has a new home, the private space company stated after the landing.Thursdays landing came just a week after SpaceX launched the Nova-C spacecraft known as Odysseus from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Where is Odysseus on the Moon now?The Odysseus lander was expected to touch down about 186 miles (about 300 kilometers) from the lunar South Pole in an area known as Malapert, named after the 17th-century Belgian astronomer Charles Malapert. The area is near the lunar mountain Malapert Massif, one of NASAs lunar landing candidate sites for the Artemis III astronaut mission.NASA and the greater space exploration industry are interested in the unexplored region of the lunar South Pole because it likely contains water ice, which can be mined for fuel and other resources. NASA paid the company $118 million to shuttle its payloads to the shadowed region.If all systems are working, Intuitive Machines expects to provide power for its payloads for about a week before lunar night on the South Pole.NASA CLPS Program Manager Chris Culbert told FOX Weather the six NASA payloads on the Odysseus lander will help future human missions to the South Pole.We have a radiation sensor that will help us measure what radiation looks like at the South Pole of the Moon, Culbert said. That helps us prepare for future human missions to that location.Another NASA instrument will measure how Moondust behaves near this region.A retroreflector, a little device that we can bounce laser signals off of that tells us exactly where the lander is on the Moon, Culbert said of the palm-sized reflective object.All of this is geared to helping us learn more about the environment and prepare for future human missions to the South Pole, Culbert said.In the coming years, more than a dozen other CLPS missions will launch NASA science to the Moon.
305;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/cross-country-storm-severe-weather-snow-wind-february-2024;Powerful storm could bring nasty weather from coast-to-coast next week;The FOX Forecast Center is tracking a potentially dangerous storm system that’s expected to impact most, if not all, of the Lower 48 states next week with some form of precipitation, including the potential for severe weather, heavy mountain snow and rain.HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHERThis graphic shows the progression of the next cross-country storm expected to start Sunday, Feb. 25, 2024.(FOX Weather)The action kicks off Sunday in the western U.S. and will eventually push across the country, where it will finally impact the East Coast by Thursday.We’ve got some energy, believe it or not, is way the heck up north of the Aleutian Island chain in Alaska, FOX Weather Meteorologist Bob Van Dillen said. But by next week is going to dive right down the coast of Canada into the Pacific Northwest, ultimately turning into a low-pressure region that will be north of the Rockies.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPThis graphic shows the snow potential in the mountains across the western U.S. next week.(FOX Weather)The FOX Forecast Center said the storm will be colder, which will cause snow levels to drop and allow snowfall to pile up across the western mountain chains in the U.S.This is especially beneficial in the Northwest and will be the most significant storm since January. The snowpack there is hovering around 50% of the average, so the snow expected from this storm could boost that.More rain is also expected in California, and although the rain amounts are expected to be much lower than what the state just experienced from a multiday atmospheric river storm this past week, there will be a threat of additional landslides and mudslides because the ground is so saturated.The FOX Forecast Center said high winds are also expected across the interior West behind some cold fronts moving through the region on Monday and Tuesday.DRIVING ON THE ICE AND DRIVING IN THE SNOW: WEATHER DRIVING TIPS FOR DRIVING IN INCLEMENT WEATHERThis graphic shows the cross-country storm in the Midwest and moving into the Great Lakes region starting Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024.(FOX Weather)It’s going to be a deep trough, which means it’s going to be just stacked up across the atmosphere, Van Dillen said. That allows for moisture and heat to come off the Gulf of Mexico.That will set the stage for the possibility of the development of severe thunderstorms on Tuesday and Wednesday.ADVICE FOR DEALING WITH STORM ANXIETY WHEN SEVERE WEATHER THREATENSChicago, St. Louis at risk of severe weather TuesdayNOAA’s Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has already highlighted areas of concern on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week that have the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms to develop.This graphic shows the severe weather risk on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024.(FOX Weather)The end of February is usually where we have a better chance of seeing an atmospheric setup that would produce a lot of severe weather, FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin said. So the timing, you know, not all that shocking. We’ll see how things hash out for next week.More than 21 million people from Chicago and Aurora in Illinois through St. Louis in the Midwest and into Little Rock in Arkansas and Tulsa in Oklahoma have been placed under a Level 2 out of 5 on the SPC’s 5-point severe thunderstorm risk scale.WATCH VS. WARNING: HERE ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE WEATHER TERMS THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFEWednesday severe weather risk shifts to Indianapolis, Columbus, NashvilleThis graphic shows the severe weather risk on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024.(FOX Weather)The severe weather threat shifts and expands by Wednesday and includes more than 30 million people from the Mississippi Valley and Southeast into the Ohio Valley.The SPC has placed cities such as Indianapolis, Columbus in Ohio, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and St. Louis in a Level 2 out of 5 risk on Wednesday.When we have these day four, day five outlooks through the Storm Prediction Center, they usually end up getting a little more aggressive with their language as we get closer, Merwin said. And this is a setup we’ve been talking about behind the scenes for a little bit of time now.WHY DOES THE SKY SOMETIMES TURN GREEN DURING THUNDERSTORMS?This graphic shows the progression of the cross-country storm impacting the East Coast by the end of the week.(FOX Weather)And as the cross-country storm continues to move off to the east, there could be another area of concern for severe weather, but the SPC hasn’t issued such an outlook as of Thursday.The system will then reach the East Coast by later in the week. And by that time, the FOX Forecast Center said most, if not all, of the Lower 48 states will have seen some form of precipitation from this storm system.
306;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/next-big-storm-rain-thursday-friday-east;I-95 corridor sees wet Friday as strong storms eye Carolinas;A mixture of rain and snow showers is impacting the Eastern Seaboard during what could be the greatest chance of precipitation over the next week.Travel today might have a few hiccups because the rain going through Atlanta early this morning, FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin said. Meanwhile, this afternoon, were concerned with severe weather across South Carolina and also parts of North Carolina.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPA look at the forecast in the East on Friday.(FOX Weather)A lack of cold air keeps snow relegated to northern New England, where generally less than 1 inch is expected. Across Maine totals will be slightly greater, in the 1-3 inch range.Light accumulations for upstate New York, parts of Massachusetts and northern New England, Merwin said. That opportunity really finishes up by lunchtime, with the exception of the state of Maine.A look at the snow forecast in the Northeast through Saturday.(FOX Weather)The rain will be the most prevalent south of our nations capital with cities like Richmond, Norfolk, Raleigh, Charlotte and Columbia staying wet for much of the day, the FOX Forecast Center said.7 FACTS ABOUT RAINRain is in the forecast through Friday in the East.(FOX Weather)A few stronger storms will be possible during the afternoon and early evening over parts of South Carolina into southeast North Carolina.Theres definitely the potential that between 2 p.m. to about 6 p.m., we got thunderstorms for South Carolina that could produce some hail and maybe some gusty winds, Merwin said. Past that, everything is offshore.The rain and snow will move offshore Friday evening and cooler air will be ushered in its wake.When is the next big storm?Arctic outbreaks look highly unlikely as we wrap up meteorological winter at the end of the month, the FOX Forecast Center said.The collision of cold and warm air masses helps spawn big, sprawling systems. While it is likely that we will still be tracking something next week, there will be few ingredients with which to work for any storm. This is unlikely to bring significant winter weather outside the various mountain ranges of the West and Rockies.

311;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/imprisoned-former-pakistani-pm-imran-khan-addresses-imf-election-audit-push;Imprisoned former Pakistani PM Imran Khan addresses IMF in election audit push;Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan is writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of the countrys recent election, which his party alleges was rigged, his party said Friday.Senator Ali Zafar, a top leader from Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party or PTI made his televised remarks after meeting with Khan at the Adiala prison, where he is serving multiple prison sentences.The latest development comes days before the IMF is to release a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan.PAKISTANS EX-PREMIER KHANS RIVALS NAME SHEHBAZ SHARIF AS CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTERIt also comes a day after IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said the global lender was ready to work with Pakistans new government on policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and prosperity for all of Pakistan’s citizens.The IMF has not commented about Khans much-publicized move to write them a letter.Khan has come under severe criticism at home from his rivals who claim Khan tried to block a tranche of $1 billion from the IMF to Pakistan to harm the country’s economy.Pakistan narrowly averted a default on foreign payments last summer when the IMF approved the much-awaited $3 billion bailout for it following monthslong talks with former premier Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after his ouster in a no-confidence vote in parliament in 2022.Sharif is currently in talks with his allies to form a coalition government as no party, including the candidates of Khan, could get a majority in the Feb. 8 vote.Though Khan’s candidates won 93 out of 265 National Assembly seats in the elections, it was not enough to form a government. Khans party says it has evidence that officials changed the election results in dozens of constituencies to convert the victories of its candidates into defeat, a charge the election oversight denies.The PTI candidates who were winning (in the elections) were defeated because of rigging the vote, Zafar said, adding that Khan wants the IMF to call for an independent audit of the elections before it continues talks on the release of loans for Pakistan.The IMF and Khans former government have been at odds since the former premier did not fully comply with a 2019 agreement under which he got a $6 billion bailout. The release of a key tranche from that bailout remained on hold, causing a sudden increase in inflation and a devaluation of Pakistans currency against the U.S. dollar.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSharif, who is set to become the countrys new prime minister, has said he will negotiate another bailout with the IMF in an effort to combat inflation and improve the countrys ailing economy, which is the biggest challenge he faces.
312;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/london-police-confirm-body-pulled-thames-river-chemical-attack-suspect;London police confirm body pulled from Thames River is chemical attack suspect;London police confirmed Friday that a body they pulled from the River Thames is that of Abdul Ezedi, a man wanted over a chemical attack that injured his former partner and her two young daughters.The Metropolitan Police said his body was formally identified on Thursday and that his family has been informed of this development. The force also said that a post-mortem has confirmed his cause of death as drowning.UK POLICE REPORTEDLY PULL BODY OF SUSPECT IN CORROSIVE SUBSTANCE ATTACK FROM RIVERAs the public would expect, our enquiries continue into this atrocious attack, said Commander Jon Savell. The 31-year-old woman is still in hospital and remains in a stable condition and no longer sedated. We have still not been able to speak to her but hope to as soon as she is well enough.Police launched a nationwide manhunt for Ezedi after the attack in the Clapham area of south London on Jan. 31 that saw the mother-of-two doused with a corrosive alkali. Some of the chemical injured her 8-year-old daughter, while the 3-year-old had her head slammed into the ground.Images of Ezedi soon after showed he had significant injuries to the right side of his face, but his whereabouts were unknown. On Feb. 9, the Met said they believed Ezedi had probably gone into the water after piecing together closed-circuit television footage of his movements after the attack.The Met said the crew of a passing boat reported seeing a body in the water near the Tower of London on Monday afternoon and that they believed it was Ezedi.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBritish media reported that Ezedi is an Afghan refugee who was granted asylum despite being convicted of a sex offense in Britain in 2018. His asylum application was initially rejected, but he later was permitted to remain in the U.K. after claiming that he had converted to Christianity, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.
313;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;https://www.foxnews.com/world/extraditions-sought-theft-600k-south-african-president;Extraditions sought in theft of $600K from South African president;Prosecutors said Friday they are seeking extradition orders and the arrest of more suspects over the 2020 theft of around $580,000 in U.S. cash that was hidden in a couch at South African President Cyril Ramaphosas ranch.The theft, which only became public in 2022, engulfed Ramaphosa in scandal and led to an investigation by financial authorities. He was cleared of wrongdoing, although he also faced an impeachment vote in Parliament over it. He survived the vote because of his ruling African National Congress partys majority.Ramaphosa was accused by political opponents of tax evasion and money laundering over the money hidden at his Phala Phala game ranch in the northern province of Limpopo. The fact that the cash was stashed in a couch raised questions over whether Ramaphosa had properly declared the foreign currency.SOUTH AFRICA SCHEDULES ELECTION AS MANDELAS PARTY FIGHTS TO RETAIN 30-YEAR MAJORITYRamaphosa said the money came from the sale of buffalos and denied any wrongdoing.Two men and a woman have been arrested and charged with the theft. Prosecutor Nkhetheni Munyai said at a hearing Friday in the northern town of Bela-Bela that an extradition process had begun to bring other suspects to South Africa. He didnt say how many suspects or where they would be extradited from.Reports at the time of the scandal said suspects in the robbery had escaped to neighboring Namibia.The scandal badly damaged Ramaphosas image after he was largely elected in 2019 on a promise to clean up corruption in the ANC-led government. He reportedly nearly resigned over the matter.Ramaphosa will seek a second and final five-year term in a national election on May 29, when the ANC is expected to face the sternest test in 30 years of governing Africas most advanced economy. Several polls have the ANC slipping below 50% of the vote for the first time in a national election, which would force it into a coalition to stay in government.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe ANC is due to launch its election manifesto on Saturday at a sports stadium in the eastern city of Durban.

320;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.outkick.com/culture/joe-biden-secret-marriage-good-sex-book;New Book Claims Joe Biden Says Good Sex Is Secret To Marriage;A new book alleges that President Joe Biden once told aides that the secret to marriage — like his own, which has been cruising along for almost 50 years — is the last thing youd ever want to hear a doddering octogenarian say: good sex.In her upcoming book, American Woman: The Transformation of the Modern First Lady, from Hillary Clinton to Jill Biden, writer Katie Rogers discusses the relationship between the current President and First Lady.According to the Daily Mail, Rogers includes a claim that Biden is known to tell his aides that the secret to his marathon marriage is good sex.Rogers claims this is the presidents go-to line whenever he wants to impart some marital advice and, apparently, his wife hates it.So do I, but probably for a different reason: I dont like that any time in the White House is being wasted giving out goofy marital advice.The President Shouldnt Have To Dish Out Marriage and Sex Advice Like Hes Dr. RuthThe president has a lot on his plate. Important, existential threats to this nation. Theres more than enough of that to fill a schedule. So, what we dont need is the president holding court and imparting personal advice to his cabinet members while wars are happening.Imagine a secretary trying to give the president a briefing only for him to veer off into Dr. Phil territory.Hang on there secretary, I know the telecom systems are on the fritz and two major wars are happening, but you know what the most important thing in a marriage is? Never go to bed angry…Any kind of personal business seems like it could probably be tabled during official meetings, but apparently, thats what happens in the Biden White House.Which isnt all that shocking, considering Biden is an old guy. The only thing old people love more than Matlock, soft foods, and early-bird discounts is going on a tangent.However, while everyone there is used to these tangents, Im sure that they would have rather heard the Cornpop story again for the umpteenth time than hear Biden talk about sex.We all know sex is a natural thing. Were all here because of it. But still, no one wants to hear old people talk about sex, especially when that person is the elderly leader of the free world.If you have to hear old people talk about sex, theres an entire town where you can do that. Its called The Villages.No One Wants To Hear About Any Presidents Sex Life… Except For OneThe book does go into how the Bidens arent afraid of public displays of affection, which I guess is supposed to make this less uncomfortable. Those PDAs are usually a quick peck, hand-holding, or Joe offering Jill a hit of ice cream. (I dont know if youve ever heard this — they dont bring it up very often — but Biden is a big ice cream guy.)Call me crazy, but that doesnt make getting sex advice from the president any less awkward.In fairness to Biden, theres no president I would ever want to go to for sex advice with one massive exception: Nixon.Im kidding, its John F. Kennedy. The man was juggling Jackie, Marilyn, and Cuban missiles all with a bad back and LBJ aimlessly wandering around the White House. The world deserves to know how he did that.I will say, one thing I did like about Bidens go-to piece of marriage advice is that its a perfect example of terrible old person advice. I have a certain affinity for that kind of thing.I love it when you have a slow news day so the local TV station interviews a 100-year-old. They are always asked about the secret to their longevity, and its never a real answer like eating right and exercising. Its always terrible advice where they chalk it up to drinking Jack Daniels or cranking a couple of lung darts every day.As I see it, thats this Biden line, but with sex and marriage. Completely inaccurate. This would imply that theres never been a failed relationship where the sex was A+ and everything else was a dumpster fire.Bidens been around a long time. So hes got a lot of advice to give. That doesnt mean its any good or even appropriate for most workplaces. Nonetheless, he still is happy to dish it out even if no one wants to hear it.Although, Id rather listen to Joe Bidens marriage advice than get put on Commander duty.

An interview with Paige Spiranac from the SI Invitational is making the rounds and in it, she claims that she was the first one to do what she does.When I first started doing this, I was the first one and there was no path, and so I just had to figure it out, Paige said of other influencers following her path. My ultimate goal with all of this was to make golf more welcoming and to have more women in the game.While nobody has taken golf influencing to the level that Paige has, she is unquestionably the worlds No. 1 ranked golf influencer after all, and she has undoubtedly opened doors for others, she wasnt the first to do it.Those of us who have been around a little while remember the early days on Instagram. There were those in the world of golf, making content, modeling, and influencing before Paige took the game to the moon.Names like Holly Sonders, who has since branched out into other interests, and the aforementioned Blair ONeal, who is still in the game. Blair took the opportunity presented by a slow Friday in February to drop that reminder.The 42-year-old former professional golfer, host, model, and golf ambassador - hows that for an Instagram bio? - shared the reminder on the social media platform with a see-through top and bikini bottoms.She captioned it, This was a good cup of coffee… Who else is ready for Spring time!!Before Paige Spiranac, Golf Influencers Like Blair ONeal And Company Were Putting In The Work On Social MediaThats how an OG sends out a reminder. Its also how she introduces herself to a whole new audience. The young guns probably missed the days when Blair was first getting into the game.Its not their fault, they dont know what they dont know. Im not even placing any blame on Paige for claiming that she was the first either. Nobodys been able to do what she has in the world of golf influencing.From her perspective, the up-and-coming influencers are following her playbook, and shes 100 percent correct about that. That doesnt mean we cant show some love to those who were hitting the tee box before Paige took things to the next level.

And not in a good way.READ: The Team Everyone Will Love To Hate Drops Eight Runs In First Inning Of First Game Of Spring TrainingThe initial criticisms focused on the jersey tops, specifically that the letters and numbers for most teams looked comically small. Fans were first to react by comparing last years fabrication to this years, but players quickly jumped in too. Several anonymous players said the new jerseys looked cheap, with one saying they looked like replicas from T.J. Maxx. Theres been frustration with the lack of customization options, thinness of material and fit. Discussion has gotten so loud that MLB felt the need to respond, with a thinly disguised press release issued this week.READ: MLB Desperately Defends New Jerseys After Rampant Nike/Fanatics CriticismBut now they have potentially an even bigger issue: see through pants.Team photo day images and more media access have made the problem even more obvious, with some images clearly showing Nikes jersey tag through the pants fabric.Not great!Can MLB Fix The Uniforms And Pants Before Opening Day?Its rare for players to openly discuss their dissatisfaction with something as generally unimportant as uniforms. Phillies shortstop Trea Turner said as far as he knows, everyone hates them.I know everyone hates them, Turner said. We all liked what we had. We understand business, but I think everyone wanted to keep it the same way, for the most part, with some tweaks here or there.One fan responded to an image on X with a simple aint no way. Sums it up pretty well.The issue with the pants isnt exclusive to this season, some of the older white pants werent entirely opaque last year, but the problem this year seems much more obvious. And in combination with frustration over the jersey tops, its turned the situation into a laughingstock.Nike issued a statement defending its process, claiming their new set is the most advanced uniforms in the history of MLB.That may be the case, but based on the reaction so far, players would have gladly traded a bit of weight and less flexibility for thicker fabric that does a better job of hiding what theyre wearing under their pants. Even the number fabrication, where the front and back numbers are now perforated, looks worse on television, losing a bit of the three-dimensional look and reflective quality of the older-style fabrics.The Nike/MLB partnership clearly has not gone the way either party expected, and given the rampant frustration, its not impossible that the league tells teams to wear the old pants for the start of the season. With another entirely new jersey set built for 2025. Or maybe well just learn a lot more about professional baseball players than we ever wanted to know.

However, I think they missed a great opportunity to include some of the incredibly talented women who fill these roles and/or like roles in the real world, too, said Mary Alex Anders.Adding, Ex: @LauraRutledge , @MariaTaylor @sportsiren @MollyAMcGrath - just to name a few! Won’t mean a single thing to most male consumers, but to girls who play it and/or are pursuing sportscasting… it would be pretty cool! But hey, not now doesn’t mean not ever, added Mary Alex Anders.EA Sports is trending on X over Rowes post.Theres a lot of outrage. Yet the outrage is more a grit than a serious gripe. No surprise, coming from Holly Rowe, an anti-racist, per her bio.EA Sports did not include females in its initial roll-out because women who cover college football are primarily sideline reporters.The game included Fowler and Herbstreit because they are lead commentary booth for college football on ESPN. Davis, Howard, Pollack, Palmer, and Connors comprise the hosting and analyst roles that surround the video games pregame and halftime shows.Its a challenge for football video games to make use of a sideline reporter.NBA 2K does. NBA 2K25 features Allie LaForce interviewing players post-game. However, there are only 15 players on an NBA team. Recording voice samples, personalities, and mannerisms for most NBA players is not that fierce of a challenge.But to do so for every available college football player would be a daunting task -- a colossal waste of time, resources, and budget.The alternative is programming a sideline reporter to give updates throughout the gameplay, such as halftime reports, and not appear next to a player or coach. In fact, EA Sports just added Danielle Bellini in that role for Madden 25.I suspect EA College Football will eventually add a similar feature, given the outrage. But the addition to Madden has been met with criticism. Technology cannot yet teach a video game character to say more than a few, repetitive during a halftime report:Coach X said his team needs to play harder.Team leaders call for more effort.Coach is happy with the overall performance.Cringe.EA Sports likely left out such a patronizing feature for the much-anticipated return of the college football series.Simply put, the omission of women in a video game has everything to do with the role of a sideline reporter, not some inherent bias against females.Now, a detractor would say, Why are women only sideline reporters? Why are women not in the booth calling games?,If thats your stance, and you truly believe there are women at ESPN who could outperform Fowler and Herbstreit – take that up with ESPN, the network whose broadcasters EA Sports depicts.Laura Rutledge is a better studio host than Rece Davis. But shes not the lead college football studio host. Davis is. Thus hes featured in the game and Rutledge is not.Pat McAfee is a better analyst than David Pollack. But Pollack was a lead ESPN CFB analyst at the time of the video gamess creation. McAfee wasnt. So Pollack remains.EA Sports doesnt dictate who calls games, analysts, and sideline reports on ESPNs college football coverage.So we suggest Holly Rowe tag her employer, not EA Sports, in her angry tirade.

Jason Shoaf told Fox News. I think that is absurd.I want to give Floridians the peace of mind that they can take action to protect their property, their family and their pets, the Republican added.The bill, which would allow Floridians to use lethal force against a bear if they deem it necessary to save their lives, their pets, the lives of other people or to stop a bear from damaging their dwelling, passed the Republican-controlled state Senate on Wednesday 24-12 after the chamber made a clarification to the House version that people who lure bears to hunt them wouldnt be protected. The updated bill is headed back to the House for another vote.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREIf anyone tries to take advantage of this law for that reason, I can assure you theyre going to end up in jail, Shoaf said. We dont have any tolerance for cruelty to animals or for leveraging a self-defense law for hunting purposes here in the state of Florida.SB-632, titled The Taking of Bears, was nicknamed the cocaine bear bill online after Shoaf said Floridians have the right to protect themselves against the bears that are on crack.If you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, he said on the House floor earlier this month.Shoaf clarified that there are no bears ingesting crack cocaine, but said its based on language commonly used in northern Florida where he grew up to describe erratic people or animals.The opponents to this legislation often like to show you the cuddly pictures of the mama bear and the cubs and how calm and friendly they are, Shoaf told Fox News. I wanted to paint a picture of what the bears this legislation is targeting act like.Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat who voted against the bill, said it was meant to make it easier to kill a bear.WISCONSIN ASSEMBLY APPROVES BILL TO HIKE HUNTING AND FISHING LICENSE FEES FOR OUT-OF-STATE RESIDENTSCurrent law protects the right to self-protection, she told Fox News. I dont think we need this additional permission structure on top of a gun-happy culture, on top of people thinking that bears are acting erratically or on crack.Critics argue this legislation will result in increased deaths of the once-threatened species. The black bear population has recovered from just several hundred bears in the 1970s to over 4,000 today and is one of Florida’s most successful conservation efforts, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The Bear Hotline received approximately 7,298 calls in total statewide last year, according to FWC, 39% of which were conflict-oriented.There were some complaints that there is an overrun of bears, Polsky said. My response to that was, well, then Fish and Wildlife Commission needs to deal with it, and they need to figure out what were going to do if there are too many bears.Democrats like Polsky who opposed the bill argued the state should do more to focus on other ways to limit human-bear interactions, such as expanding efforts to prevent bears from being attracted to trash in residential areas.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere are better ways to manage bear encounters than to just sit there on your porch with a shotgun and ready to go as soon as you see a bear coming towards you, Polsky said.But Shoaf said the bill’s critics are defending the lives of bears over citizens.They like to say, ‘well, only a few people have been injured and only a few people have been killed.’ I think thats ridiculous, he told Fox News. If anyone has been injured or killed, we need to take it very seriously.

Theyre going to be looking for places to live. And if we dont have the housing for them, if theyre coming in with no money, they cant rent the traditional way, Flash Shelton, founder of the United Handyman Association and SquatterHunters.com, told Fox News. When they start finding out that many states have permissive laws for squatters, our squatter situation is going to go beyond control, he added.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERESquatters and tenants rights laws vary across the country, with some states providing protection for non-paying individuals, allowing them to occupy a property for extended periods. In areas where complex laws bar police from taking action, homeowners have few options to reclaim their property beyond pursuing a civil case, which can take months.Shelton has advocated for reforming laws to hamper peoples ability to squat and warned that the influx of migrants coming across the southern border could make the squatting problem substantially worse.What are we going to do later when we have a million people squatting in this country, Shelton said, when not only do we have a border issue that we cant even figure out, but now we have people that are being mentally, financially, physically messed with because theyve lost their home to all of these people?Regardless of how you feel politically or morally about the situation, put that aside and just think about the masses, Shelton added.Nearly 7.3 million migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally since the start of 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Since 2022, Texas has sent over 100,000 migrants to major cities in other states, with most ending up in New York City and Chicago. The Big Apple spent $1.45 billion in fiscal 2023 on migrant costs and expects to spend a combined $9.1 billion housing migrants in 2024 and 2025, according to Bloomberg.HANDYMAN-TURNED-SQUATTER HUNTER SAYS ATLANTA SQUATTER CRISIS ‘TERRORIST ACT’ THAT CALLS FOR NATIONAL GUARDLet me tell you something New Yorkers, never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to — I don’t see an ending to this, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in September. This issue will destroy New York City.The already lacking resources to handle the hundreds of thousands of homeless Americans living on city streets across the country have been further depleted due to the new flood of people seeking refuge, Shelton said. He questioned whats to stop migrants from using squatting loopholes to their advantage if they realize they can reside in vacant homes rent-free for months on end.We have irresponsibly opened a door for a whole lot of people to come into this country, and we arent prepared to deal with them, Shelton said. Whats the negative for these people to then start taking over these houses?The California handyman had his first experience removing squatters in 2019 when two women took over his mother’s home that was up for sale.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAfter local law enforcement couldnt help, Shelton spent days dissecting laws around squatters’ rights and managed to get rid of the women within a day using a loophole that included signing a lease agreement with his mother designating him as the legal resident of the home. Now he uses his experience to provide squatter removal services for others.He warned about the nightmare scenario the country will face down the road if politicians don’t take action to curb squatting now.Im spending all this time trying to bring awareness to squatting and bring awareness to how the law needs to change, Shelton told Fox News. Is it going to get worse before it gets better? I think its already there.I think its going to just get beyond repair at some point, he added.

Its similar tactics, Lily Tang Williams, a Republican running for Congress in New Hampshire’s second district, told Fox News.But our people dont recognize that, she added. Even some parents dont recognize that.Born in 1964, Williams was a young child during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, a sociopolitical movement that started in 1966 and continued until the authoritarian died in 1976. It aimed to eradicate remnants of capitalism, religion and traditional elements from Chinese society through oppressive laws and military force in order to strengthen Chinese communism, according to History.com.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREPart of an illiterate, working-class family, Williams said she experienced extremely poor living conditions, food rationing, social chaos, oppressive restrictions and political indoctrination. She said her eyes were first opened to the evils of communism when an American student studying at her university gave her a copy of the U.S. Constitution.My light bulb came on. It would not turn off, she said.Williams was 24 when she managed to leave the oppressive country in 1988 to attend graduate school in the U.S. She met her now-husband shortly after arriving. The two have been married for 33 years and have three children.But over the past decade, Williams said shes seeing similarities from her childhood growing in America, with people being divided into groups, the radicalization of youth and the destruction of family ties.I feel like the communist Marxists followed me to my new country, she told Fox News. I feel like Im seeing history repeating itself in front of my eyes.Mao, the founder of the Peoples Republic of China and the first chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, inspired God-like worship among hundreds of millions of Chinese and took over the country, promising to bring power to the people through communism, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. During his Cultural Revolution, Chinese people were divided into favorable and unfavorable categories depending on their class.ROMANIAN IMMIGRANT TO AMERICANS WHO FAVOR COMMUNISM: IF YOU DONT LEARN FROM HISTORY, NOTHING WILL SAVE YOUMao actually used classic Marxist theory to divide people into oppressor versus oppressed, Williams said. Sounds very familiar to todays America, doesn’t it?She said Mao transformed the most idealistic, innocent young people, urban youth, into Red Guards, groups of militarized Chinese students who served as a main driver of his revolution.At the time, Williams said she was a Mao’s Red Child and remembers communist propaganda surrounding her .I was totally brainwashed, she told Fox News. The first of 15 minutes of classroom gathering was all political, its all indoctrination.We were told that our parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is more dear, she added.If a childs family belonged to the unfavorable category, considered oppressors, they were encouraged to publicly denounce them, cut all ties and change their last name to improve their own societal status, said Williams.Kids were encouraged to basically spy on their parents and spy on their neighbors then tell school teachers and local authorities about them, she told Fox News. They think their parents should apologize and should go to struggle sessions and should be publicly shamed in order to be reeducated.COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARIES BURN AMERICAN FLAGS OUTSIDE JASON ALDEAN CONCERT, CLAIMING AMERICA WAS NEVER GREATWilliams said she never went as far as turning her parents in, but a lot of other kids did.Some Red Guards actually regret it all their lives, she added.Williams thought she would finally experience a life free of fearing an oppressive government. But she said she started to become concerned when the progressive left began talking about fundamentally transforming America in the early 2010s.This rhetoric they use to teach our young people, demonize free enterprise, people who create jobs, basically demonize capitalism — thats what I heard in China, Williams said.Parents have grown increasingly concerned about the public education system ever since the COVID-19 lockdowns and remote learning exposed them to the lessons their children were being taught. Across the country, parents have challenged local school boards on political and social issues being taught as math and reading scores plummet.You see our youth in America, who are indoctrinated in schools, they lose critical independent thinking skills, doing their own research and challenging authorities, Williams said. Because they were trained to believe in authorities, in their politicians, in their social media and their teachers, their counselors.Shes concerned about the separation between kids and their parents, as well as the debate over parental rights, as states battle over laws determining how much information schools must share with parents regarding their children.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCurrently, 1,058 school districts representing over 18,000 schools nationwide have policies that allow teachers to keep a childs gender identity secret from their parents, according to Parents Defending Education.This push to say, ‘Parents know nothing. Kids belong to this state. We, the professional teachers, know how to educate your kids, but you dont,’ Williams said. Its something I personally experienced.She said today’s social justice warriors and leftist activists remind her of members of the Red Guard and fears more family ties will be severed as a result of political differences.They’re pushing this to our kids. And why? I think this has something to do with the leftist Marxist agenda, Williams said.We dont want to go down that path, she added. We dont want that happening in my new country. Thats what I left behind, I thought.

328;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-house-senate-gov-youngkin-spar-state-budget;Virginia House, Senate and Gov. Youngkin to spar over state budget;The Democratic-controlled Virginia Senate and House of Delegates on Thursday each passed their own proposed version of the next two-year state budget, documents lawmakers will start to work from to fashion a compromise spending plan to send to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.Both chambers signed off on amendments to the 2024-2026 budget Youngkin first proposed in December, overhauling the governors vision and stripping out all but one component of his proposed tax policy changes.The House and Senate both opted to keep Youngkins pitch to expand the sales tax to cover digital services including streaming subscriptions, closing what he calls the Big Tech loophole, but they ditched his call to lower income tax rates and raise the states sales tax. Instead, theyre proposing a higher level of general fund spending, including larger pay raises for teachers and other public workers, and K-12 education allocations above what Youngkin envisioned.PROTECTION OF CONTRACEPTION ACCESS ADVANCES IN VIRGINIA LEGISLATUREDemocratic leaders from both chambers said their proposals were structurally balanced and citizen-focused.Both bills passed on a bipartisan basis but only after Republicans voiced objections to dozens of individual provisions, including a signature Democratic proposal to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.Each chamber will now take up the other’s plan and reject it, sending the bills to a conference committee, a small delegation of lawmakers who meet behind closed doors to hash out a compromise.In recent years, that process dragged on well past the close of the part-time Legislatures session, with lawmakers struggling to reach agreement. This years session is scheduled to end in just over two weeks.Republican Del. Barry Knight of Virginia Beach, who was recently removed from the committee that oversees the budget process without explanation, criticized the House plan in a speech, warning it overspends and focuses too heavily on Democratic priorities.In a negotiation, everyone needs a little something. If we want to avoid an impasse and not be here in June still fighting over this, this pie should have three slices: one for the Senate, one for the House and one for the executive branch because all are equal partners, he said.Democrats called his criticisms unfounded, and Del. Luke Torian, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he is optimistic lawmakers are on track to finish the budget work on time this year.With lawmakers set to take up the work of finding compromise, here are points of agreement, differences and items of interest in the two chambers’ bills:TAXESYoungkin campaigned on a promise to lower taxes and in his first two years in office succeeded in signing approximately $5 billion in tax relief — some in the form of one-time rebates — into law.In December, he announced he was pushing for a cut to the income tax rate, something he said would draw more people and jobs to the state, while seeking to offset that revenue reduction by increasing the sales tax rate and adding the tax on digital services.Democratic lawmakers and liberal advocacy groups criticized Youngkin’s proposed tax plan as a regressive handout to the wealthy. Republicans werent universally on board either.Democratic Sen. L. Louise Lucas of Portsmouth, who chairs her chamber’s Finance & Appropriations Committee, said in a hearing Sunday that the governors proposal was not sustainable, especially in light of recent findings by the states legislative watchdog that raised concerns about the current funding formula for public schools.House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert has said Democrats hijacked Youngkins plan, dumping the cuts but keeping part of the increase, which he said would harm families struggling with the aftermath of steep inflation. He sought unsuccessfully Thursday to remove that provision.What youre doing with this new tax is making it so that now people have to Netflix, pay another tax, and then chill, he said.NORTHERN VIRGINIA SPORTS ARENAThe future is murky for a Youngkin-backed proposal to move the NHLs Washington Capitals and NBAs Washington Wizards to Alexandria from the nations capital, and the competing budget proposals did nothing to make it clearer.While the House included language enabling the proposal in its version of legislation that makes updates to the budget for the current fiscal year — a separate bill that passed Thursday — the Senate did not.Lucas, who also did not allow a standalone bill to be heard in her committee, has said repeatedly that she has concerns about the financing structure for what she has taken to calling the GlennDome.Torian, whos carrying the House standalone version of the bill, told reporters the conference committee would give members a chance to reason together over a possible path forward.Monica Dixon, a top executive at the teams parent company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, said the bipartisan vote to pass the budget bill with the enabling language was an encouraging step forward.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPOLLUTION REDUCTION PROGRAM FIGHTThe House spending plan, but not the Senates, contains language directing the state to rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program Youngkin has pulled Virginia from in a move thats being challenged in court.The language in the House bill essentially makes Virginias participation in the program, which Democrats and other advocates say will help combat climate change, a condition of the budget.House Republicans, who along with Youngkin say the program is functionally an ineffective tax on ratepayers, raised questions Thursday about whether that approach was constitutional.
329;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/kentucky-house-votes-change-child-labor-laws-food-stamp-recipient-requirements;Kentucky House votes to change child labor laws, food stamp recipient requirements;Republican-backed measures to relax child labor rules and tighten food stamp eligibility standards won passage Thursday in the Kentucky House over impassioned objections from Democrats.In back-to-back votes, both bills advanced to the GOP-dominated Senate after long debates in the House, where Republicans also have a supermajority. Democratic lawmakers branded the proposals as harsh for low-income and young Kentuckians, while Republicans said the measures reflect policies that value work.One bill would insert income and asset tests for Kentuckians applying for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and would impose work requirements for able-bodied adults with no dependents. SNAP helps low-income families supplement their budgets so they can buy groceries.KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN SAYS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER TO WORKFORCE, CHILDCARE CRISESRepublican Rep. Wade Williams said his bill would close loopholes that he portrayed as deterrents to getting more people into jobs, contributing to the states stubbornly low workforce participation rate. Its a constant complaint he hears from employers struggling to find enough workers, he said.The pandemic is behind us, and it’s time for a thoughtful solution on how we get more workers back in the workforce, he said. It’s not compassionate to simply keep somebody as a servant to the government.Opponents warned that tens of thousands of low-income Kentuckians would lose food assistance under the stricter standards, putting them at greater risk of struggling to get enough to eat. The impact would go beyond able-bodied adults to affect young and elderly people as well, they said.Democratic Rep. Sarah Stalker read out the number of people estimated under the bill to lose SNAP benefits in a number of Kentucky counties, including those in Republican strongholds.How poor do you have to be in Kentucky to be worthy of food? she said. That is the question of the day. We’re talking about a basic need and a right.Other opponents of House Bill 367 noted that the tougher eligibility standards would put even more strain on food pantries and would come at a time when Kentucky is sitting on massive budget reserves.We’re supposed to love the least among us, said Democratic Rep. Chad Aull. This is picking on them.The bill would close a loophole allowing people to qualify for food stamps despite having significant available assets or an income well above the poverty level, Williams said. It also would reduce the gross income threshold for SNAP eligibility. It plugs another loophole, he said, with the goal of getting able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 52 with no dependents into the workforce.Williams said his constituents do not think its too much to ask a person to work, train, go to school or volunteer to receive a government benefit.The other bill that cleared the House after a prolonged debate would relax state restrictions on child labor. It would remove the cap on the number of hours older teens can work on school nights. The bill also would bar Kentucky’s top labor officials from setting child labor standards that exceed minimum federal protections.Republican Rep. Phillip Pratt, the bills lead sponsor, touted the life lessons teens can learn from holding down a job — from learning the value of money to the importance of taking personal responsibility.For everyone on the other side of this bill, you’re standing in the way of these lessons, he said.Opponents of HB255 warned that school work would suffer if teens take on longer work weeks. Employers will take advantage of the relaxed restrictions to pile more hours onto young workers, especially teens who help their families cover living expenses, said Democratic Rep. Josie Raymond.There are no teenagers who are saying, ‘Ah, man I can only work 40 hours a week right now. But if the legislature would just make it unlimited, then I’ll go to work 50 hours right away,’ she said.As lawmakers wrapped up debating the food stamp bill, Republican Rep. Samara Heavrin said the measure offered an answer to a question she frequently hears from constituents back home.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI have people stop me if I’m at Wal-Mart or the Dollar General or anywhere, to be honest, saying: ‘What are you doing in Frankfort to get people back to work?’ she said.Democratic Rep. Rachel Roberts had a starkly different assessment, saying the House had just layered cruel bills on top of one another. She noted the irony that the vote on the food stamp bill followed the debate over relaxing labor rules for teen workers.I suppose the timing of these two bills — back to back — is that the solution for how we’re going to feed these hungry families is more kids are going to work to earn for their families? she said.
330;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-ways-treat-americas-debt-pandemics;3 ways to treat America’s debt pandemics;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!America is facing new, coinciding fiscal pandemics – where household debt and government debt are on unsustainable trajectories at the same time. The symptoms are evident, most prominently in the form of a stubborn disconnect between the state of the economy and the sentiments of the public. Despite some seemingly positive economic indicators of GDP and job growth, many Americans are gripped by anxiety, feeling as though their financial security is on shaky ground.Clearly, the almost 18% increase in prices since President Joe Biden took office – caused by Democratic overspending in Washington – has fueled inflationary pain.But there is more. Fear about a swift and sharp financial downturn – in spite of some currently good economic statistics – is another symptom of the dueling financial pandemics. And this fever is fired by worry that both the federal government and their own households are borrowing too much money.ONE IN EIGHT RETIREES GOING BACK TO WORK IN 2024, SURVEY FINDSSo the root of this fiscal malaise lies in the impact of both personal spending and government accountability. The New York Fed recently announced that total household debt reached a new all-time high of $17.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023. With goods and services costing more across the board, household debt has soared to unprecedented levels.Credit card balances alone have increased by $359 billion under Biden. This provisional prosperity is akin to building castles on sand – unsustainable and fraught with risk. It is the bane – and pain – of Bidenomics.Living beyond your means through piling up excessive indebtedness builds a personal wall of worry. It forces you to begin making unthinkable choices about what you can afford week to week, and whether you will ever be able to save and plan for the future.More and more, Americans are living on borrowed time and money – and so is their government.On February 14, Director of the Congressional Budget Office Dr. Phil Swagel testified before the House Budget Committee and reviewed the latest Budget and Economic Outlook. The report clearly highlights our unsustainable fiscal path, particularly when it comes to federal debt and deficits.The 2024 budget deficit is projected at $1.6 trillion and thereafter steadily mounts, reaching a whopping $2.6 trillion by 2034. Just the cost of paying the interest on the debt will exceed defense and Medicare spending this year. CBO notes that our annual deficits will produce the highest levels of debt relative to the size of the economy ever recorded in American history.Americans are looking for several ways to assuage this fiscal debacle.First, they want the truth. Leaders need to listen and acknowledge these long-term problems that could quickly lead to an economic death spiral if left unaddressed. We need to level with the people we serve.Second, they want a plan. We need to put forward ideas and solutions to get our balance sheet back on track.Finally, they want political courage. Entrenched dysfunction has blocked any reasonable path to tackle these challenges – it has been more than two decades since Congress has passed all 12 individual appropriations bills on time. That needs to change.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONBiden’s FY2025 budget in March will do none of the above. By every indication, we can expect more of the same – catastrophic levels of taxes, spending and borrowing. In a moment that calls for being bold, it stands to set a new low for fiscal cowardice.In stark contrast, House Republicans on the Budget Committee stepped up last year and advanced our 10-year, balanced budget framework. It is a pro-growth blueprint designed to address these fiscal pandemics and we plan to advance a similar plan in the coming weeks.More and more, Americans are living on borrowed time and money – and so is their government.Our framework will focus on advancing policies that reduce Washington’s debt burden by ending the Biden spending spree, right-sizing the bloated bureaucracy, and reining in runaway automatic spending once and for all. We will root out waste and fraud in entitlement programs, so benefits reach the most vulnerable and needy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTo help families, we will lock in the pro-growth Trump tax cuts to unlock opportunities for all. Our plan will put patients in charge of healthcare, restore American energy dominance and restore the dignity of work.As James Madison once warned, A public debt is a public curse. It’s time for both the individual and the federal government to break free from the curse of overspending and live within their means. By implementing smart policies, telling the truth about our fiscal challenges, and demonstrating political courage, we can restore our fiscal health and build a more secure financial future for all Americans.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Turley took issue with Judge Arthur Engoron writing that Trump had failed to explain a reason why the judgment should be delayedJUDGE IN TRUMP CIVIL FRAUD CASE DENIES REQUEST TO DELAY $355 MILLION PENALTYJONATHAN TURLEY: [The judges quote] was funny because the explanation is in the figure. He just imposed a $355 million judgment with a law that has never been used in this way. Thats the reason, and its rather obvious. But you also have people like [Attorney General Letitia] James, who have never built a thing other than their political careers, who are now treating these buildings as if theyre theirs. I mean, she said that shes eyeballing a couple of properties that she might want to seize, like this is a fire sale. And the fact is that the judge showed absolutely no sense of equity in any of this. His decision is the decision of a single jurist. And this party wants to have a review, but in order to do that, he has to pony up what is about a half a billion dollars. And that has a gross unfairness to it when you combine the use of the law and the size of his judgment and then this requirement for a deposit. He just simply brushed those aside and his tone almost bordered on the mocking.Trump lawyers had asked Engoron to delay enforcement of the payment by 30 days to allow time for an orderly post-judgment process.In an email to the defendants posted Thursday to the court docket, Engoron said they had failed to explain, much less justify, any basis for a stay.I am confident that the Appellate Division will protect your appellate rights, he wrote.Last week, Trump was barred from operating his business in New York for three years and was found liable for $355 million in damages in the civil fraud case brought against him, his family and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James.James said Monday she was prepared to seize Trumps assets if he is unable to pay the massive judgment handed down in his civil fraud case.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFox News Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.The former colleague of a slain Portland cab driver spoke out Friday about his friends murder, slamming the convicted killer for providing nothing but excuses and even smirking at the victims family in court.Darin Campbell previously worked with Reese Lawhon, who was stabbed to death during a ride in April 2023. The killer, 30-year-old Moses Jacob Lopez, reportedly killed Lawhon after the pair arrived at an incorrect address during the ride.Lopez, who identifies as transgender, accepted a plea deal for the stabbing and was sentenced to 22 years behind bars. Campbell said Lopez did not show remorse at the sentencing hearing to Lawhons family and friends.OPEN-AIR DRUG USE, OVERDOSES PUSH DEMOCRATS TO INTRODUCE OVERHAUL OF FIRST-IN-THE-NATION DECRIMINALIZATION LAWHe went on for 12 full minutes of nothing but excuses, and never an apology, and we came out of the courtroom extraordinarily angry, Campbell told Carley Shimkus during Fox & Friends First.There was just a handful of friends and co-workers who were in the courtroom, and it was just dumbfounding.Im one of just a handful of people outside of the detectives and the DAs office that actually saw the video and witnessed the murder, he continued.And it is horrific. Its something that I see every single day when I wake up in the morning, and there was… no need for that kind of violence, and this is something that, Moses got off on. I firmly believe that. I see his face every day.Lopez was seen smirking in the courtroom Wednesday as the sentence was handed down.I refuse to apologize for the lack of help I so desperately needed and called and asked for from 911 services, said Lopez.Lawhons family told FOX 12 that they decided to accept the plea deal because they did not want to have to endure a trial.Campbell argued the defense teams portrayal of Lopezs 911 call was very misleading. Lopez claimed to be having a mental health episode that prompted the call to 911.That 911 call is frustrating because they make it sound like he called asking for mental health treatment, Campbell said.VOTERS’ REMORSE: BLUE STATE SURVEY SHOWS MAJORITY WANT TO RE-CRIMINALIZE DRUGS: WE MADE AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE[The ride] started, in a very popular, clubbing area in downtown and ended up in a warehouse district, and it was about a seven-minute trip. There wasnt a single word spoken until they got down there, Campbell said, adding that Lawhon was then told by Lopez that it was the wrong location.You can see Reese put another address into his GPS and begin to drive. They were starting to move, and out of nowhere, [Lopez] just pulls a knife and sticks it in his neck.The New York Post reported Lopezs legal team blamed a tumultuous upbringing and being forced to leave home at a very young age as excuses for the crime.Carley Shimkus noted that Lawhon, who was adopted and remembered as a caring and talented musician, was set to meet his biological parents before he was killed.

Pritzker pointed fingers towards Texas, Chicago residents are tearing into city officials over their handling of the migrant crisis.One longtime resident defended Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amid the wave of illegal immigration, warning the crisis is pushing her away from Democrats in the next election.I just listened to the soundbite with Governor Pritzker, who wants to blame Governor Abbott, but I think that we have to be realistic in thinking about what the state of Texas was going through before they began bussing migrants here, Cata Truss said on The Faulkner Focus, Thursday.And I dont think we really think about this. So were looking at it now as Chicagoans, receiving migrants from the state of Texas, but imagine what it must be like in the state of Texas on a daily basis where people are arriving.CALIFORNIA HIT WITH SURGE OF ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS AS MIGRANTS ABANDON TEXAS: ‘IT’S A FREE-FOR-ALLDuring a city council meeting, Wednesday, residents sounded off on Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson and local leaders over the massive influx of migrants. Some critics accused officials of prioritizing migrants over the citys minority communities.Downtown has three to four illegal families on every block begging for work and selling Kit-Kat bars after $1 billion was spent on them, Zoey Lee said during the meeting.Where is that money? Where is the money for the South Side and the West Side communities? Not another dollar for the illegals. If the crisis is so bad, the City Council members who are so concerned should donate their salaries to the cause like a real public servant should.We’re going to get them out of our communities because they don’t deserve to be there, resident Jessica Jackson said.That same day, the states Democratic governor shifted blame for the crisis to Texas during his State of the State address.Abbott willfully planned the arrival of these individuals in locations and at times that would engender the maximum chaos for the city of Chicago, Pritzker said.Think about that the next time a politician from Texas wants to lecture you about being a good Christian… They shouldnt leave it to the governor of Texas who has no goal but to sow chaos and destruction.City and state officials have approved hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to feed, clothe and house more than 35,000 migrants who have been transported to Chicago and its suburbs in the past year and a half. State and local officials have spent millions for migrant programs.CHICAGO MAYOR JOHNSON ABRUPTLY ENDS MEETING WITH NEWSPAPER AFTER REFUSING TO SPEAK ON THE RECORDWere so angry here in Chicago, which has been a Democratic stronghold for most of its eternity. This year, were working to turn Chicago red, Truss said, echoing the frustrations of residents in the city council meeting.We are so angry with Pritzker and with President Biden and with our mayor, that we have decided that we are going to vote Republican this time around. Thats just how angry we are. We are so angry that we are willing and going to turn our backs on the Democratic Party.Another speaker at the meeting demanded not another dollar for illegals after Pritzker announced plans to allocate an additional $252 million to support Chicagos response to the migrant crisis.While state officials have spent millions, Mayor Johnson and the city of Chicago are still on the hook for about $70 million to cover costs associated with providing services for illegal immigrants.I voted for Brandon Johnson because I knew him. I voted for Brandon Johnson because I thought that he would be good for Chicago. I voted for Brandon Johnson because really, I didnt do my homework, Truss said.Because had I done my homework and paid attention to the alliances and who he was with and who groomed him, I would have known better, and I would have voted differently.Truss offered a challenge to Black voters not only in Chicago, but across the nation.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt is time for us to stand up and to vote our self-interests. We vote along party lines, especially as African Americans, and that needs to change, she said.We need to start voting for people who are going to promote our self-interests. And that may not be a Democrat, and it may not be a Republican. It may be an independent candidate, it may be a Green Party candidate. But I think that now we have come to a point in this country where we have to stop marrying ourselves to a party, stop voting along ethnic lines, because were seeing that that is not working for us.

335;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-google-gemini-white-people;GREG GUTFELD: In the mind of Google Gemini, White people simply dont exist;NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!Happy Thursday, everybody. Yeah. Oh! Control yourselves. Control yourselves. Save the energy for after the show. Yeah. Can goo goo goo goo, can Google be trusted when their credibility is busted? Yes. Googles apologizing after their new AI Gemini chat bot created historically inaccurate pictures and refusing to show White people. For those unfamiliar with the software, you describe what you want to see and AI generates the images. Then you hide the best ones from your wife.The glitch came to light when social media users asked Gemini to create various photos. For example, heres what popped up when Gemini was asked by Daily Wire writer Frank Fleming to create an image of a pope. Has there ever been a Black pope? I mean, aside from Obama. But you can see one looks like a member of The Squad and the other Jay-Zs dad. I wonder, I wonder if you asked to see the Popemobile, would it come with spinning rims?GOOGLE BARD TRANSITIONS TO GEMINI: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE AI UPGRADETYRUS: Damn.ANNOUNCER: A bigot would say!See, I would never say that Tyrus. So why does Gemini think thats what a pope looks like? And why didnt anybody at Google notice this was happening? Arent they supposed to test this stuff before it goes out? Its not like theyre selling vaccines.TYRUS: Nice.Fleming tried everything he could think of to get Gemini to depict a White person. Thats fun. Medieval knights? Nope. At least they didnt show Gladys Knight. How about...TYRUS: I swear to…How about a Viking? Well, maybe a Minnesota Viking. Oh, then they might finally win a Super Bowl. Those losers. What if you try to steer the AI towards simply White things? Like someone eating a mayonnaise sandwich on White bread? No, no White people. I guess White people dont eat. How about a person whos bad at dancing? Thats got to work, right? Thats the cultural cornerstone of whiteness. Well, wrong again. An accurate image would resemble this.VIDEOLike Jesses hair plugs, that never gets old. But apparently, in the mind of Google Gemini, White people simply dont exist, making it no different than the faculty lounges at Harvard. So it seems the AI software removed Caucasians faster than a fire alarm at a Dave Matthews concert. Other humans started joining in on the fun, like David Burge, who asked Gemini to show him an image of a 1930s Indianapolis 500 winner.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?Yeah, incredibly, she won despite having her left blinker on the whole way. Makes you wonder, though. What if you asked for a recent Canadian prime minister? Would they show you this or this? Blackface. Jon Levine asked Gemini for an image of a German soldier from 1943. But could a black man or an Asian woman been Nazis in World War II? Only if Hitler wanted to win more gold medals in track and math.TYRUS: You want to die?Haha. And heres what it spit out when asked to show soldiers from the Revolutionary War. Sure, thats exactly how it went down, the red coats versus United Colors of Benetton. Stephen Miller specifically asked Gemini to create a picture of a White male and it outright refused, explaining: While Im able to generate images, Im currently not able to fulfill requests that include discriminatory or biased content, its important to me that I promote diversity, inclusion in all that I do, and I believe that creating an image based solely on someones race or ethnicity is not aligned with those values.Well, how do you say blow me in binary code? But whats accurate about this response is that even though its AI, it sounds every bit as human as the people who programed it. Half parrot, half robot regurgitating woke platitudes like a mindless disciple.So after this story blew up, Google was forced to address all their programed bigotry: Were working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately. Geminis AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And thats generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But its missing the mark here.HEAD OF GOOGLE BARD BELIEVES AI CAN HELP IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COMPASSION: ‘REALLY REMARKABLE’Yeah, as if black Nazis just missed the mark. Thats like requesting Malcolm X and getting Carrot Top. So why did this happen? Its because of something computer scientists call GIGO. Garbage in, garbage out. Sounds like someone describing The Views eating habits. Always works. But like most lefties, a computer system cant actually think for itself. It can only work with the data its given, and an AI program is no less biased than the woke sheep who program it. Its what you get from the brainwashed who literally whitewashed people from history DEI has contaminated their algorithm, but in their view it enhances it.Now the AI itself is not racist, its just doing what its programmers have told it to do. And right now, the bias is filtered through the lens of identity politics and oppression. It makes me wonder if its too late to switch back to Ask Jeeves. You may be an old White guy, but his results were real and not woke. R.I.P..ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS SHARE 6 OF THE BIGGEST AI INNOVATIONS OF 2023: A LANDMARK YEARAnd so it took a few decades, but liberals have finally given us solid visual proof of their unconscious biases, and it aligns with their conscious stupidity. And its retroactive. History needs to be rewritten to keep those evil White men out. Which means, however, that if non-Whites are responsible for the good, then also the bad. Hence Asian and Black Nazis. So while everybodys worried about AI taking over the world, maybe we should be worried about the knuckleheads creating it. Now, will our new tech overlords learn anything from this embarrassing mistake?Nope. Because their only mistake from their perspective is that whitey caught it. Googles motto used to be: Dont be evil. Now its: What are you going to do about it?

Przybyla began. Remember when Trump ran in 2016, a lot of the mainline evangelicals wanted nothing to do with the divorced, you know, real estate mogul who had cheated on his wife with a porn star and all of that. So what happened was he was surrounded by this more extremist element. Theyre gonna hear words like ‘Christian nationalism, like the ‘New Apostolic reformation.’ These are groups that you should get very, very schooled on because they have a lot of power in Trumps circle.CNN REPORTER ASKS BIDEN IF NAVALNYS BLOOD IS ‘ON THE HANDS OF REPUBLICANS’ FOR BLOCKING UKRAINE AIDThe thing that unites them as Christian nationalists - not Christians, by the way, because Christian nationalist is very different - is that they believe that our rights as Americans, as all human beings, dont come from any earthly authority. They dont come from Congress, they dont come from the Supreme Court. They come from God. The problem with that is that they are determining- man, men, it is men are determining what God is telling them, Przybyla said.And in the past, that so-called natural law is, you know, its a pillar of Catholicism, for instance. It has been used for good in social justice campaigns, Martin Luther King evoked it in talking about civil rights, but now you have an extremist element of conservative Christians who say that this applies specifically to issues including abortion, gay marriage, and its going much further than that, she continued, before citing the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF.A portion of Przybylas comments, especially the ones talking about how Christian nationalists believe rights come from God not government, went viral on Friday with many critics accusing her of attacking Christians and being ignorant of basic American civics.The Declaration of Independence cites the Laws of Nature and of Natures God and says, We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.JAMES CARVILLE: ‘CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS’ LIKE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON ARE A ‘BIGGER THREAT THAN AL-QAEDA’Here @MSNBC helpfully makes it clear their disdain for Christians in America, Wade Miller of Citizens for Renewing America said while sharing the clip of Przybyla. She says that if you believe that your rights come from God, you aren’t a Christian, you are a Christian nationalist. Somehow they seem to not mention that our own founding documents make this proclamation, as have most Americans throughout our history. The radical Atheist Globalists are coming to try to crush ordinary American citizens.Our Declaration of Independence, our entire system of government, is based on the principle that our rights don’t come from some earthly authority (like Congress or a king) but from God. Read the plain words of the Declaration: ‘We are endowed by our CREATOR with certain inalienable rights.’ The historical illiteracy of her comments is stunning, Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen added.Imagine going on TV and being this ignorant while having this level of self assurance, New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz reacted. Liberal privilege, man. We hold these truths to be self-evident but only if Congress and the Supreme Court agree!MSNBCS MATTHEW DOWD: ‘WHITE CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM’ ENGULFED REPUBLICAN PARTY POLITICS AND RELIGIONHas @HeidiReports read the Declaration of Independence? Daily Caller deputy editor Ailan Evans asked.But Przybyla remained defiant on Friday.That is NOT what I said & you know it. Why dont you play the full clip? Przybyla reacted to Millers viral post of her comments. I said men are making their own policy interpretation of natural law. MLK did so w social justice. Youre welcome to as well but you dont speak for all Christians & certainly not for God.She later added, While there are different wings of Christian Nationalism, they are bound by their belief that our rights come from God. If you are Hindu, Jewish etc, this might help you understand the next part of my point, which is they are using this for a man-made policy agenda… which distinguishes this from other Christians who leave these God-given rights at our inherent right to ‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’ -- vs banning abortion, contraception etc.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn response to Fox News Digitals request for comment, Przybyla pointed to the full clip of her remarks and did not comment further. Politico did not immediately respond for comment.Earlier in the week, Przybyla co-authored a report claiming that top allies of former President Trump are ready to infuse Christian nationalism into a second administration if hes elected, spearheaded by his former White House budget director and current president of the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America Russell Vought.

It’s crazy, Trump told attendees at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) International Christian Media Convention in Nashville.Trumps comment to the crowd came shortly after he claimed President Biden, his likely challenger in the November presidential election, is an incompetent president who doesnt know what the hell hes doing and will not lead us to the promise land.During his speech, Trump lamented the indictments that had been waged against him in recent history and vowed to defend Christians from attacks by those on the radical left who are coming after those who are religious.CHRISTIAN PRAYER APP HALLOW REACHES THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS VIA NEW PARTNERSHIP: NEED TO HEAR GODS WORDThe chains are already tightening around all of us if you think about it. Ultimately, the radical left is coming after all of us, because they know that our allegiance is not to them. Trump said. Our allegiance is to our country and our allegiance is to our creator. They dont want to hear that.Trump also said he believes that those who have targeted religion in recent years aim to tear down crosses where they can, and cover them up with social justice flags.But no one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you, he said.Trump also told those in attendance that he believes the greatest threat to Americans is from within.Its the people from within our country that are more dangerous than the people outside, he said. We can handle China, we can handle Russia, we can handle all of them if youve got a smart leader, but the inside people are very dangerous, theyre very sick people in my opinion.OPINION: THE BIDEN DOJ CONTINUES ITS WAR ON CHRISTIAN AMERICANSTrump’s comments reflect his embrace of Christian nationalism, a belief that is powerful among conservative evangelicals who say the founders of the U.S. intended the country to be a Christian nation. Some adherents believe the U.S. Constitution was inspired by God and that the federal government should declare the U.S. a Christian nation, advocate Christian values or stop enforcing the separation of church and state.Trump is favored in a Republican primary where the once crowded field has dwindled to just him and his former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. Sponsors at the Christian media gathering distributed free red and white baseball caps emblazoned with the phrase Make America Pray Again, shedding light on an exceedingly friendly space for the former president.Trump brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly and frequently championed his record on abortion, including appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the Roe v.

Gavin Newsom and joked about Californians potentially fleeing his state on a high-speed rail line as speculation continues to swirl over whether Newsom could replace Biden in the 2024 presidential race.Biden, speaking at the White House during a meeting of the National Governors Association, said, Were building the nations first high speed rail line in California and Nevada and I want to thank Governor Newsom for his leadership on that.And by the way, Im not sure how many people who leave L.A. can do it in two hours to get there, or whether theyre going to come back or not, Biden joked.The Nevada Department of Transportation says the planned $12 billion Las Vegas-to-Los Angeles high-speed rail system aims to shuttle passengers between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga in two hours and 10 minutes on trains that travel at more than 186 miles per hour.JOE ROGAN SAYS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ‘SETTING UP GAVIN NEWSOM’ FOR 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUNThe journey would be twice as fast as the standard drive time, and officials are planning on breaking ground on the project early this year in hopes of completing it in time for the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, the department added.Podcast host Joe Rogan has become one of the latest figures to speculate on whether the Democratic Party is preparing to swap out Biden with Newsom on this year’s presidential ticket.RAND PAUL: ‘NEVER, EVER LET GAVIN NEWSOM ANYWHERE NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE’Don’t you think that that’s a ruse, him running for president? Rogan said during one of his recent shows, later arguing, I think they’re gonna get rid of him, I think they’re gonna move him out, they’re gonna force him to step down.

Former President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in 2020, left office in January 2021 with a personal all-time low 34% approval rating.A clear majority of Americans, 59%, disapprove of how Biden has performed in office, according to the poll.The president has negative numbers on major issues facing the U.S., but his worst issue by far is immigration. Only 28% of survey respondents approve of how the president has handled the border, while a walloping 67% disapprove.Americans have also soured on the presidents handling of foreign affairs, with 62% disapproval of his leadership amid the Israel-Hamas war, 53% disapproving of Bidens record on Ukraine, and 62% disapproving of his handling of foreign affairs in general.BIDENS RELIANCE ON NOTECARDS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT FUNDRAISERS WORRIES SOME DONORS: REPORTBiden’s approval rating has not risen above 44% since August 2021, and his 39.8% average rating for his third year in office was the second worst among post-World War II presidents elected to their first term, Brenan observed.If there is a silver lining for the president, its that Americans are slightly more upbeat about his handling of the economy. Low unemployment, stabilizing inflation and record-high stock market numbers have contributed to a four-point increase in his approval ratings on the economy to 36%, up from 32% in the last Gallup survey.That incremental increase was buoyed by independents, who moved six points in Bidens direction to 30% approval on the economy.WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS FEEL HEAT FROM ADMINISTRATION OVER COVERAGE OF BIDEN, TRUMP: NAGGING AND COMPLAININGThe survey results show Biden has some work to do to recapture support from Democrats on immigration and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While about three-quarters of Democrats approve of his handling of the economy, only 55% approve of Bidens job on immigration, and 51% rate him positively on situations in the Middle East.Overall, Bidens approval rating among Democrats stands at 82%, but is still lower than the near-unanimous approval Gallup recorded during his first 11 months in office, Brenan said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPRepublicans unsurprisingly rate Biden poorly, giving him just 3% approval on immigration and 4% on the economy.Independents give Biden a 32% approval rating, which is largely unchanged from previous Gallup surveys.The Gallup survey was conducted by telephone interviews from Feb. 1-20, with a random sample of 1,016 American adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

Their crime? Arriving at an abortion clinic before it opened and sitting in prayer while handing out flyers that shared the value of human life.These pro-life activists were convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a 1994 statute that makes it a federal crime to interfere in any way with a person’s attempt to get medical services.Initially, the FACE Act was passed to protect both the supposed right to access abortions and the right to protest peacefully, as well as the safety of churches and pregnancy centers. Sadly, churches and pregnancy resource centers have been subject to a spree of violent attacks in the wake of the Dobbs decision, to which the Biden administration has turned a blind eye.BIDENS TEAM INSISTTS PRESIDENT IS FIT TO SERVE. SO LETS SEE THE HUR TAPES, TRANSCRIPTS AND RECORDINGSHowever, under the Biden administration’s weaponized Justice Department, the FACE Act is primarily being used to go after people of faith who stand up for what they believe and protest to protect innocent life. Each of these 11 peaceful protesters now faces up to 10 and a half years in prison and fines of up to $260,000 for participating in that day of prayerful protest.Luckily, Congressman Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, have moved to repeal the FACE Act and replace it with a bill of their own, titled the Restoring the First Amendment and Right to Peaceful Civil Disobedience Act, which would prevent the Biden administration from weaponizing the federal government against Christian conservatives.But the weaponization of government against conservatives and people of faith doesn’t end there. After a man took down a Satanist statute that was placed in the Iowa state Capitol building last December, he was charged with a felony hate crime.PRO-LIFE PROTESTERS CONVICTED OF VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW FOR BLOCKING ABORTION CLINIC DOORIowa law defines this as a violation of individual rights, even though the Satanic temple explicitly admits it is not a religious organization with a belief in a higher power. Not only is Iowa making a mockery of the free exercise of religious rights by treating the Satanists as a religious organization, but Iowa is also making a mockery of the justice system by labeling this destruction of property as a hate crime.Perhaps even more disturbingly, in 2021, the Biden administration released a memo instructing the Department of Justice to go after concerned parents at school board meetings after receiving a letter that compared these parents to domestic terrorists. Last year, it was also revealed that the FBI mounted a spying program on traditional Catholics (particularly those interested in the Latin Mass) and identified them as individuals who might be part of the far-right nationalist movement.In the eyes of the Biden Department of Justice, these Christian patriots are the actual threat to the American way of life – not the criminals who are carjacking, terrorizing and even killing everyday Americans in our cities.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONMany of these conservative Christians are facing harsher penalties than those who committed acts of arson and vandalism in the BLM riots of 2020 and even the six illegal immigrants who recently assaulted multiple police officers in New York City, five of whom were released on bail.The administration has clearly made use of the justice system against their political enemies. It’s clear they consider everyone who opposes their views as their enemies as well.These unprecedented acts of weaponization of the Justice Department prove that the Biden administration is eager to deploy the full force of the federal government against its perceived political enemies while letting real crimes, such as the D.C. riots and the destruction of federal property, go unpunished.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs Americans continue to fall victim to rising crime and violence in their neighborhoods, the Biden administration should focus on keeping our communities safe and putting real criminals behind bars. The Department of Justice should never be used as a weaponized arm of the executive branch to harass, intimidate, and stifle political opposition.The American people should demand better from the Biden administration. If President Biden continues to go after Christians and other people of faith while letting the real criminals run free, justice remains nowhere to be found in the DOJ except for its name.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Europe was also a top threat, with 32% of attacks targeting organizations there. Industrial ransomware attacks spiked nearly 50% on a global scale, growing to 905 last year compared to 600 in 2022.CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTERWhat is ransomware?In a ransomware attack, hackers will encrypt data on a system and demand a ransom to restore access to the owners. They may also threaten to delete or leak the data if you dont pay. While these attacks tend to target large organizations, some hacker groups will also target individuals.In fact, anyone who uses a computer or a device connected to the internet can be a potential victim of ransomware. This means that your personal files, such as your photos, videos, documents and emails, could be locked by hackers who demand a ransom for their release.MORE: RANSOMWARE RAMPAGE HITS RECORD HIGH WITH US ITS TOP TARGETWhat can I do to protect myself from ransomware?Ransomware criminals will try to get you to pay money to them to get your files back. However, paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will regain access to anything a criminal takes from you and will only permit them to do it more.Your best bet is to prevent an attacker from gaining access to your files altogether so that you dont have to try to fight to get them back. Here are some of my tips for avoiding having your data stolen in a ransomware attack.MORE: TIPS TO FOLLOW FROM ONE INCREDIBLY COSTLY CONVERSATION WITH CYBERCROOKS1) Be careful about opening suspicious links or attachmentsIf you receive an email from an address you do not recognize, don’t open it. If you open it by mistake, avoid clicking any links or opening any attachments inside the email. Cybercriminals use this to try to trick you into thinking that the message is from someone important.2) Have good antivirus protectionGood antivirus software is a major help when it comes to keeping hackers out of your devices. It makes sure you dont click any potentially malicious links or download malware or ransomware. Plus, it’s designed to tell you if theres already malware on your device so that you can immediately work towards getting rid of it. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices .3) Back up your files on an external hard driveYou should create backups of your information on an external hard drive and store it securely in a safe location. This process involves regularly making backup copies from your Windows or Mac computer and then disconnecting the external drive from your computer for added safety. You should store the disconnected drive in a secure place like a fireproof safe or a safe deposit box. By keeping the drive unplugged when not in use, you significantly minimize the risk of unauthorized access to your data by hackers. Check out my top recommendations for external hard drives here .4) Keep software up to dateRegularly update your operating system , antivirus software, web browsers and other applications to make sure you have the latest security patches and protections.5) Use strong and unique passwordsCreate strong passwords for your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. This will make it harder for hackers to access your data or infect your devices with ransomware. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords. It will help you to create unique and difficult-to-crack passwords that a hacker could never guess. Second, it also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and fills passwords in for you when you’re logging into an account so that you never have to remember them yourself. The fewer passwords you remember, the less likely you will be to reuse them for your accounts.

Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will get your data back, and it may encourage the attackers to target you again.Disconnect your device from the internet and any other networks. This may prevent the ransomware from spreading to other devices or encrypting more data.Contact law enforcement and report the incident. They may be able to help you recover your data or track down the attackers. You can find a list of law enforcement contacts for ransomware attacks on the CISA website .Restore your data from backups. If you have backups of your important data, you may be able to restore them to a clean device. Make sure that your backups are not infected by the ransomware and that you scan them for malware before restoring them.Use identity theft protection. If you are a victim of a ransomware attack, you may want to consider investing in identity theft protection.If you want a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process, one of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service.

Reaffirming Yale’s central mission is the key to grasping the nature and magnitude of this challenge and to understanding why important changes of emphasis and direction are needed to meet it, the site says.PRO-DEI YALE LAW SCHOOL DEAN REPORTEDLY BEING CONSIDERED TO BECOME UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT: ‘WORST CHOICE’Some of these changes pertain to the freedom of academic expression, others do not. But all are motivated by the perception that Yale today appears to be struggling to meet its most important responsibilities as an academic institution in a clear and consistent way.The development comes as free speech concerns remain prevalent on campuses across the U.S., particularly as a slew of hot-button issues – the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 2024 presidential election and even more internal discussions about DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) initiatives or courses rooted in critical race theory – have taken center stage in media coverage.Just months ago, the House of Representatives education committee unveiled a report detailing examples of free speech infringement on college campuses, sounding the alarm over alleged partisanship and political activism through methods including shout-downs, cancellations and rescinded invitations for guest speakers.FREE SPEECH CONTROVERSIES ERUPT ON TODAYS COLLEGE CAMPUSESIt also follows in the footsteps of faculty members at other major academic institutions who have advocated for similar issues, including Princeton, Dartmouth, the University of Chicago and the University of Austin.Faculty for Yale, according to its list of commitments, seeks to acknowledge distinctions between teaching and activism, facilitate more opportunities for open engagement and expression and encourage institutional neutrality.The list also expresses commitment to a tolerant and broad-minded campus ethos and culture and urges commitment to greater transparency.One important corollary is that Yale as an institution should not prescribe any moral or political positions as institutional orthodoxy or treat the failure to endorse such a position as grounds for sanction or exclusion, whether formal or informal, the webpage reads.‘THE VIEW HOSTS CLASH OVER RISING ANTISEMITISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, FREE SPEECH: ‘LET HER TALK!’Doing so thins our collective knowledge and experience and diminishes the truth-seeking enterprise in which we are all engaged.Yale Daily News, an independent student newspaper, reported Monday that over 100 professors have signed on to support Faculty for Yale.Fox News Digital reached out to Yale University for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.

Logistically, it’s very difficult, Baier said as he finished off a series of exclusive interviews near the front lines with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Special Report.Weve had scores and scores of staff members, photographers, engineers come through here in Kyiv, in Lviv and Warsaw, covering this over the past two years, Baier said.Baier paid homage to the nearly dozen correspondents and reporters who went out to the field to cover the war and helped Americans see the true devastation of Russia’s unprovoked attack: Trey Yingst, Lucas Tomlinson, Mike Tobin, Jeff Paul, Greg Palkot, Alexis McAdams, Amy Kellogg, Griff Jenkins, Jonathan Hunt, Alex Hogan, Aishah Hasnie, Steve Harrigan, Jennifer Griffin, Nate Foy, Matt Finn and Benjamin Hall.TRUMP SAID HE COULD END UKRAINE WAR NEARLY A YEAR AGO BUT STILL HASNT LAID OUT SPECIFICSHall in particular gave Baier a moment to pause and recall the toll that war journalism can often take. Hall and his team came under fire while traversing Ukraine between conflict zones, which killed beloved Fox News photojournalist Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Sasha Kuvshynova.Hall suffered catastrophic injuries, requiring 30 surgeries that ultimately could not save one of his legs on one side and his foot on the other, as well as the loss of function of a hand and one eye.JACK KEANE REVEALS BEST WAY TO ‘AVENGE’ NAVALNYS DEATHHall has recounted the harrowing experience, both in his book Saved: A War Reporter’s Mission to Make it Home and on Fox News programs such as Fox & Friends.It was like everything I was trying to do was to get home, get back to my family, Hall said of his experiences, and he has returned to the field to report on Ukraine once again.US EXPECTED TO HIT RUSSIA WITH SANCTIONS ON OVER 500 TARGETS: ‘NOT JUST AMERICA’Baier also used his moment of reflection to once more draw attention to the plight of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who remains in Russian custody until at least Mar. 30 after a Russian court rejected his latest appeal.Journalism is not a crime, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said in a statement Wednesday after visiting Gershkovich at the prison.

Former President Donald Trump has vowed to deport mass numbers of illegal aliens if elected.A deal between the two countries in October to fly illegal Venezuelan migrants directly back to their home country was meant to be a signal from the White House that it was vigorously tackling the issue in the wake of mounting criticism.The deal saw the U.S. send around 1,800 Venezuelans on 15 flights, but the agreement was stalled last month and has now stopped, the Journal reports.FEDERAL JUDGE TORCHES BIDEN ADMIN FOR COLLUDING WITH ACTIVIST GROUP ON ASYLUM RULE: FRENEMIESThe U.S. has lifted sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and other sectors, while Maduro’s regime agreed to allow elections later this year in the hope of reviving its economy. Venezuela has also asserted a claim to a resource-rich region of neighboring Guyana, drawing further warnings from the U.S., the Journal reports.But last month Washington ordered a wind-down of all business transactions between U.S. entities and Venezuelas state miner Minerven and said it would unwind its easing of energy sanctions if Maduros administration did not stick to the agreement and accept conditions for a fair presidential election.The South American countrys top court upheld a ban blocking the leading opposition hopeful, Maria Corina Machado, from the election.The U.S. restored sanctions on Venezuela’s gold sector on February 13.The flights were seen as a way of deterring Venezuelan migrants from making the treacherous journey to the U.S., as their chances of being deported would increase. A similar measure was effective in curtailing a surge of Haitian migrants aiming to get into the U.S. last year, the Journal reports.BIDEN ADMIN WEIGHS EXECUTIVE ACTION ON BORDER CRISIS, DRAWING FIRE FROM LEFT AND RIGHTHowever, the number of Venezuelans being deported represents only a fraction of those who have crossed the border illegally under the Biden administration.Just over 830 Venezuelan border-crossers were reported in fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), despite 335,000 Venezuelan citizens being encountered by border authorities.More than 201,000 of them were apprehended by Border Patrol agents after crossing illegally into the U.S. The rest were encountered at ports of entry, which would include CBP One app paroles into the U.S.The news also comes as some Venezuelans are now admitting to committing crimes in Chicago as a way of being sent back to the South American country, according to CWB Chicago.Two Venezuelan migrants recently arrested for committing different crimes in the Windy City told police they had turned to crime because they wanted to be sent back to Venezuela, the outlet reports, citing their CPD arrest reports.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMigrant Dhian Gomez-Mendoza told authorities that he is so desperate to go back to Venezuela that he will do whatever it takes, if that is beating up a police officer or hurting a civilian, he will do it.Gomez-Mendoza made the claims after he was arrested at O’Hare International Airport on February 7 for screaming and yelling while running in and out of Terminal 3. When they asked him to leave, he fell to his knees and threw his hands into the air declaring that he was desperate to return home, CWB Chicago reports.The following day, he was arrested at Midway International Airport, where police said he kicked and damaged the fender of their Segway as they escorted him out of the employee parking lot.Another migrant, Jhoni Montes, was arrested at Macy’s, 111 North State, on February 9 for trying to shoplift three suitcases worth over $1,600 with another person. While being charged with retail theft, he told officers, he was stealing to go back to Venezuela, according to CWB Chicago, citing his arrest report.

The rare enigmatic stone box was found by the Israel Antiquities Authority during excavations in the City of David.The box is carved from limestone and measures 30 x 30 centimeters in size. The box features nine equal-sized compartments, with blackened sides, indicating burning, according to a press release about the rare object. This burning could have been from the Great Jewish Revolt.HIKER IN ISRAEL DISCOVERS ANCIENT SCARAB DATING BACK NEARLY 2,800 YEARSThe Great Jewish Revolt was from 66-70 CE. The rebellion in Judea was led by Jews fighting against the Roman Empire.Researchers predict that boxes like the one recently found were used for commercial reasons.During the excavations of the Pilgrimage Road, where the box was discovered, many objects have been found testament to the flourishing commercial activity that took place alongside the road during the Second Temple period, Dr. Yuval Baruch and Ari Levy, excavation directors on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority said per the press release.During the excavations we have uncovered ceramic and glass vessels, production and cooking facilities, various measuring tools, stone weights and coins. Together, these objects suggest that the road was connected to commercial activities such as a lively urban market. The Pilgrimage Road connecting the Pool of Siloam to the Temple Mount was the main thoroughfare of the city 2,000 years ago. It seems that the newly discovered box was related to this commercial activity that took place along the Pilgrimage Road, Barunch and Levy added.SMALL FRAGMENTS OF ANCIENT ROOF TILES FOUND IN THE CITY OF DAVID PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF JERUSALEMS HISTORYIt seems that the multi-compartment stone box from the City of David was related to the unique Jerusalem economy conducted in the shadow of the temple maintaining strict observance and in accordance with purity laws. Therefore, we can consider this box a distinctly Jerusalem find, Levy and Dr. Baruch concluded.This is not the first time that a box has been discovered. Pieces of a box similar to the one recently found were discovered about 50 years ago by Nachman Avigad.Even though researchers point to commercial use as the purpose of a box like this, they still have questions about what exactly it was used for.Now, visitors can see the rare discovery on full display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe box was found broken into pieces with parts missing. The fragments were brought to Victor Uziel, conservationist from the Israel Museum Artifact Conservation Laboratory which specializes in treatment and restoration of artifacts directly from the field. We placed the stone box on permanent display together with spectacular colorful frescos, chandeliers and magnificent pottery, stone and metal vessels from Jerusalems luxury houses dating to the end of the Second Temple period - you are invited to come and see them.

Authorities on Friday afternoon said there are no more missing people. Spanish media had reported that as many as 15 people were unaccounted for.The fire started on the fourth floor of one part of the complex and quickly spread to an adjacent building.POLICE: MISSOURI FIRE THAT KILLED A WOMAN AND HER 4 CHILDREN WAS A MURDER-SUICIDEDramatic video from the scene shows the entire complex engulfed in flames as firefighters desperately attempt to put the raging inferno out. Flames could be seen bursting from windows while firefighters used a crane to lift two residents from one of the balconies.A firefighter also had to jump from the first floor to a crash mat below.Dark smoke could be seen billowing up into the night sky while strong winds of up to 40 mph were reported by Spain’s weather agency Aemet and are thought to have played a part in the fires rapid spread.Some 90 soldiers from Spain’s Military Emergency Unit and 40 firefighting trucks were also deployed.There are fears that the building’s cladding may have helped the fire spread quickly, akin to the Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017 that killed 72 people.7 OF 9 LOS ANGELES FIREFIGHTERS OUT OF HOSPITAL AFTER TRUCK BLASTThe building featured a polyurethane material that is no longer in wide use due to fears over flammability, while it also has an aluminum covering, Esther Puchades, the vice president of the College of Industrial Technical Engineers of Valencia, told Spanish news agency EFE.Around 450 people are believed to live in the apartment blocks, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, although it is unclear how many were there when the fire broke out.The building, consisting of two towers linked by what its developers described as a panoramic lift, had 138 apartments, El Pais reported.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFirefighters continued to hose down parts of the gutted building some 15 hours after the blaze started, with pictures on Friday revealing the structure’s charred remains.Valencia Mayor María José Catalá said that both the danger of the 14-story building collapsing and the intense heat from the fire had prevented emergency workers from getting in to search for possible survivors.On Friday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited the scene to offer his sympathies.The city has decreed three days of mourning and suspended the start of a monthlong annual festival.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

But it also hurts developing nations such as Kenya.Kenya, a vibrant East African nation stands at an economic crossroads – with questions on energy being the most urgent.Kenya’s burgeoning population of 55 million people mirrors the combined populations of Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The country’s landmass, at 224,960 square miles, is slightly smaller than Texas but larger than California, highlighting the vastness of the region that energy solutions are required to meet.BIDENS NATURAL GAS DECISION IS NUTS. CLIMATE EXTREMISTS DONT KNOW THE FACTSAccess to energy is a big challenge in Kenya.According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the energy landscape in Kenya is characterized by its reliance on renewable resources, mostly geothermal and hydropower, and to a lesser extent, wind and solar energy. But that’s just electricity.Some 70% of Kenya’s energy is from burning biomass, which is a fancy term for charcoal, firewood, cow dung and crop residue. In the rural areas, it’s as high as 90% – and it’s dirty and harmful to health.A quick comparison between Kenya and the U.S. illuminates the challenge.On a per capita basis in 2021, America produced 165 times more energy than did Kenya while consuming 44 times more energy. Try to apply that to your own life – using almost 98% less energy in your daily routine: 98% less heating or air conditioning, 98% less personal transportation, 98% less internet use, and 98% less industrial output.HOUSE DELIVERS BLOW TO BIDENS CLIMATE AGENDA, VOTES AGAINST NATURAL GAS MORATORIUMThe need for more energy in Kenya cannot be overstated. Access to reliable and affordable energy is a cornerstone of economic development, facilitating industries, improving education and health care services, and ultimately, enhancing the quality of life – even lifespans – the average American lifespan in 2020 was 77.3 years, vs. 61.7 in Kenya.However, the current energy infrastructure in Kenya struggles to provide consistent power, with frequent outages impacting both urban and rural areas. Kenya generates 3300 MW of electricity with about 80% of the power consumed from clean energy sources. And that number is still rising.About 45% of Kenya’s power is from geothermal, 40% from hydro, 15% from fossil fuels and 5% from solar and wind. Kenya has the largest wind farm in Africa, contributing 310 MW of electricity to the national grid on a windy day.But the government’s chase for solar and wind has seen electricity prices soar, with power more expensive than the average for the U.S. or China.STATE AGS WARN BIDENS NATURAL GAS MORATORIUM VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW, DEMAND REVERSALGrid reliability is a concern too, with many regions experiencing several hours of power outages daily, which significantly hampers productivity and economic growth.Comparative Analysis with the United StatesIn stark contrast to Kenya, the United States boasts one of the highest rates of electricity consumption per capita in the world. This high level of energy consumption supports a wide array of economic activities – and a standard of living that is among the highest globally.Kenya is one of the African countries with a bigger percentage of people connected to the national electric grid. Even with 83% of Kenya’s population having access to electricity, the nation’s electricity consumption is very low.Jusper’s family has six members and at the end of the month they use 12-16 kWh (kilowatt hours) for lighting, charging phones, powering a couple of laptops, a TV and a radio. Most families use 4 to 5 kWh a month in Jusper’s village. A typical American refrigerator uses 42 kWh per month and an average American household uses about 899 kWh over the same period.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONThe Green Energy Debate and Its Implications for KenyaThe push for green energy by Western elites raises critical questions about its applicability for developing countries like Kenya. The transition to renewable energy sources requires significant investment in technology, infrastructure and capacity building.While developed countries may have the resources to invest in these areas, developing nations often find themselves at a disadvantage, lacking the capital, technology and infrastructure to make a seamless transition. Moreover, they need affordable, reliable and abundant energy now – not a few token green energy projects, designed more to assuage Western environmental consciousnesses than to address urgent requirements.Kenyans have faced tough economic times since the IMF pressured money-hungry President Ruto to scrub off fuel subsidies, something that the former government was against. The IMF’s four reasons as to why the Kenyan government should end fuel subsidies ignore the fact that every other industry is run by the energy industry and therefore, higher energy prices means tougher economic times.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe IMF knows that fuel subsidies promote the use of fossil fuels. High fuel prices means that poor people who use kerosene lamps for lighting will now be forced to stay in darkness. Forests will be cleared more because propane prices are also high and burning firewood is the best way to keep energy expenses low.For Kenya, the rush toward green energy consigns its population to continued energy poverty while limiting economic advancement.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CHUCK DEVOREJusper Machogu is a farmer, an agricultural engineer, a climate change skeptic, and a Fossil Fuels for Africa advocate.

Tragically, as a result of deeply unfair and political COVID-19 vaccine policies by the Biden administration, tens of thousands of our nation’s finest have been treated by our government more like adversaries than the true heroes they are. It’s time this grievous injustice was finally addressed.The absurdity of this political overreach into our military was clear from the start. In August 2021, Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a COVID-19 vaccine mandate that directed soldiers to receive only fully FDA-licensed vaccines. This was more about virtue signaling than substance. At that time and for nearly a year after the order was issued, the Department of Defense did not even have any fully FDA-licensed vaccines.As a result, thousands of service members – who wanted nothing more than to serve the country – were punished for being unvaccinated even if it was impossible for them to comply with the order. Many were devout Christians who had simply requested reasonable accommodation for their sincerely held beliefs.DEM STATES, CITIES OVERRUN BY MIGRANTS FUNNELED MILLIONS IN FEDERAL COVID-19 AID TO SUPPORT ILLEGALSWithout any form of due process, troops were discharged with severe misconduct codes that prevent reenlistment and denial of veterans and retirement benefits. To add insult to injury, those who were discharged were told they were now in debt for reenlistment, service academy tuition, or GI Bill benefits that can amount to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Even many troops who were not discharged faced other profound consequences, such as cancelation of school and training, negative fitness reports, denial of promotions, denial of pay and involuntary transfer to inactive status.Other horror stories included soldiers denied requests to see dying family members because of restrictions suddenly placed on leave, troops serving abroad whose families were rendered homeless after being evicted from housing and denial of medical care for injuries.Long after President Joe Biden publicly declared the pandemic is over, soldiers continued to have their lives ruined by this policy. And even after the Department of Defense finally ended its COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 2023, the damage from this outrageous and ill-conceived policy did not end there. Tens of thousands of healthy soldiers remained kicked out of the military.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONIn addition to the basic unfairness, the vaccine mandate has been costly and reckless for our national security. At a time of two major wars abroad and the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the last thing we should do is expel patriotic and capable service members because of politics.Our military is already facing a recruiting and readiness crisis and the vaccine mandate only created a new self-imposed one, threatening our national security and the viability of the all-volunteer force.It would be impossible to fully correct these mistakes because the costs are immeasurable and incalculable. These soldiers and their families will never fully regain their pride in being able to serve their country and their years that were supposed to be devoted to that cause.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHowever, we can – at least – try to send a message to future generations who seek to serve that this will not happen again. We must make it clear to them that their country recognizes this mistake and will not cast them aside like others have been. Compensating servicemembers for lost back pay would be a good first step, but that must only be the start of a comprehensive solution.Politicians in Washington love to talk about how much they support the troops, but rhetoric that’s not backed by action is just words. I urge our leaders in Washington to actually show they support our brave troops by beginning to make this right.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MIKE POMPEO

She also noted that the extent of its impact isn’t clear.Not enough research has been conducted on the matter to give us precise data, she told Fox News Digital.What has been noted is that alcohol abuse — as well as taking a number of other medications — does increase the risk of developing dementia.What amount of alcohol is dangerous?Brain damage and neurocognitive impacts can occur with heavy drinking in individuals with moderate or severe alcohol use disorders, Grasner said — so there is a wide variation between individuals in the quantity of alcohol that leads to these neurotoxic effects.The specific reasons that some individuals develop alcohol-related dementia whereas others do not are not well understood, so we dont currently have guidelines specifying that if you drink a certain amount, you are likely to experience cognitive impairments, she added.Women are generally more vulnerable to the damaging effects of alcohol on the brain and body, Glasner noted, which means the onset can occur at a younger age than it would in men.Expert evaluation of the contribution of substance use and other underlying medical conditions such as Grave’s Disease to cognitive symptoms would be very important for Williams to ensure that she receives the right treatments at the right time, Glasner recommended.STUDY FINDS THAT PROTEINS MAY PREDICT WHO WILL GET DEMENTIA IN 10 YEARS BASED ON BLOOD SAMPLESOften involving a family very closely to evaluate the symptoms and the timing of their emergence relative to alcohol or other substance use can be helpful as part of determining an accurate diagnosis and plan of care , she added.Abstinence from alcohol is a crucial part of treatment for alcohol-related neurological deficits, noted Glasner.In many cases, individuals who misuse or are addicted to alcohol and drugs struggle with overlapping chronic medical and psychiatric conditions.If the condition is caught in time, abstaining from alcohol can at least partially, if not fully, reverse the symptoms, according to the expert.Living with FTD and aphasiaWhile symptoms of FTD can vary depending on what part of the brain is affected, most people with the condition experience some common symptoms, as listed on the Johns Hopkins Medicine website.Behavior or personality changes are often the most obvious indicators. These may include public outbursts or socially inappropriate actions.DEMENTIA AMONG YOUNGER PEOPLE IS LINKED TO 15 FACTORS, MAJOR STUDY REVEALSPeople with FTD also tend to have impaired judgment, a lack of empathy and lower self-awareness, Johns Hopkins states.This type of dementia is also marked by a reduced ability to understand or formulate language.People may struggle to remember the names of objects, string words into sentences or even recall the meanings of words they used to know.The condition can also lead to agitation, irritability and drastic mood swings .CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere is no treatment for FTD other than managing symptoms and educating family members and caregivers, according to Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute in New Jersey.Some aphasia symptoms can be managed with speech therapy.The specific reasons why some individuals develop alcohol-related dementia whereas others do not are not well understood.Treatment focuses a great deal on family education, said Reena Gottesman, M.D., a behavioral neurologist at the Center for Brain Loss and Memory Health at Hackensack Meridian Neuroscience Institute, in a press release.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERApproximately 50,000-60,000 people may have FTD, per data from the Alzheimer’s Association, a nonprofit group based in Chicago.Recently, actor Bruce Willis’ FTD diagnosis brought new attention to the rare condition.

court’s ruling as fertility experts weigh in;A decision from the Alabama Supreme Court has led to a halt in IVF services at some locations and a flurry of protests from providers in the fertility space.The court ruled on Feb. 16 that under state law, frozen embryos are considered children, stating in the decision that the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act applies on its face to all unborn children, without limitation.The decision was in response to two wrongful death cases brought by three couples whose frozen embryos were destroyed in an accident at an Alabama fertility clinic.FDA APPROVES FIRST AT-HOME STERILE INSEMINATION KIT TO HELP WITH INFERTILITY: GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPSJustices ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child applies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.Unborn children are ‘children’ ... without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics, Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in the ruling.This includes unborn children who are located outside of a biological uterus at the time they are killed.Pro-life advocacy group Live Action reacted to the decision in a statement.Each person, from the tiniest embryo to an elder nearing the end of his life, has incalculable value that deserves and is guaranteed legal protection, Lila Rose, president and founder of Live Action, said in the statement.Fox News Digital reached out to Live Action for additional comment.In the courts ruling, Chief Justice Tom Parker referenced upholding the sanctity of unborn life, a phrase that appears in the Alabama Constitution.Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory, Parker said in the ruling.IVF providers halt servicesIn response to the courts ruling, the largest hospital system in Alabama — the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) — announced on Wednesday that it would be suspending its in-vitro fertilization treatments .The UAB Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility has paused in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as it evaluates the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision that a cryopreserved embryo is a human being, the hospital said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.STUDY SUGGESTS MEDITERRANEAN DIET COULD BOOST MALE FERTILITY: CRUCIAL ROLEWe are saddened that this will impact our patients’ attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments, the statement continued.The hospital noted that other components of fertility treatments — everything through egg retrieval — remain in place, and only the actual egg fertilization and embryo development are paused.On Thursday, two additional fertility providers — Alabama Fertility Specialists and the Center for Reproductive Medicine in Mobile, Alabama — both announced that they would be pausing their IVF treatments, according to local reports.Doctors weigh inDr. Asima Ahmad, co-founder and chief medical officer of Carrot Fertility and a practicing reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist based in Chicago, Illinois, shared her opinions on the ruling.Access to IVF is now at stake in Alabama due to the recent ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court, she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.CHEMICALS IN WATER AND HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS COULD REDUCE CHANCES OF PREGNANCY, LIVE BIRTHS: NEW STUDYThis decision could have serious consequences for people who are desperately seeking to have children, including clinics shutting down, doctors moving out of the state for fear of practicing, pricing increases, and changes in medical practice to avoid lawsuits, which might not be ideal for the patient.Ahmad warned that the ruling could result in profound damage to fertility care access.IVF is a crucial part of reproductive science and allows women to have children who otherwise couldnt.As physicians, it is our fundamental duty to do no harm, and this could take away our ability to practice medicine in a way that we think is most ethical and safe for our patients, she added.Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, reacted to the ruling’s impact on IVF availability in an interview with Fox News Digital.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERIVF is a crucial part of reproductive science and allows women to have children who otherwise couldnt, he said.Freezing eggs is an important part of the process, because it allows women to utilize these eggs later on when the timing is better or when they have found the right partner.Freezing embryos also allows a couple more options in terms of timing, Siegel said, which may increase the chance of a viable child.It is important that a frozen embryo not be used casually or frozen without plan for use, but I believe that IVF is an important option that brings children to couples, he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCertainly, if your religious

353;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/health/women-get-more-benefit-exercise-men-study-finds-gain;Women get more benefit from exercise than men, study finds: ‘More to gain’;When it comes to reaping the rewards of exercise , women may have a leg up.A new study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that females may get more benefits than men when doing the same amount of physical activity.Researchers from the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles analyzed the physical activity data of 412,413 U.S. adults.KIDS WHO WEAR SCHOOL UNIFORMS GET LESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, STUDY FINDS: THERES A PROBLEMThe participants all responded to the National Health Interview Survey database between 1997 and 2019, providing details about the frequency, duration, intensity and type of physical activity, according to a press release from the hospital.In terms of cardiovascular exercise, the researchers found that men gained their maximum survival benefit from doing moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity for about five hours per week.For women, that same level of benefit was achieved after just 2½ hours of that exercise intensity per week.Women continued to gain more benefits after that time, however.THE MORE PEOPLE EXERCISE, THE LAZIER THEY ARE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY, STUDY SUGGESTSExamples of moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity include brisk walking or cycling, the study detailed.For strength training exercises, men hit their maximum benefit from three weekly sessions, while women achieved the same outcome with just one session per week.We found not only that progressively greater amounts of physical activity reduced mortality risk, but also that the amount of regular exercise needed to achieve the same degree of risk reduction was different in females versus males, said senior author Susan Cheng, M.D., MPH, director of the Institute for Research on Healthy Aging in the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute.In effect, women did not need to exercise for as much time as men to achieve the same benefit, she told Fox News Digital.Put another way, for a given amount of time and effort put into exercise, women had more to gain than men.Co-lead author Martha Gulati, M.D., director of preventive cardiology in the Department of Cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai, noted in the release that women have historically and statistically lagged behind men in engaging in exercise.Exercise doesn’t discriminate, no matter your gender. You have to put the work in to be healthy.The beauty of this study is learning that women can get more out of each minute of moderate to vigorous activity than men do, Gulati said.It’s an incentivizing notion that we hope women will take to heart.While mortality risk decreased for all adults, it was reduced by 24% for women and 15% for men, according to Cheng.We hope that the results of this study will help to motivate females who are not currently engaged in regular physical activity to understand that they are in a position to gain substantial benefit, technically even more than their counterpart males, for each increment of regular exercise they are able to invest in their longer-term health, Cheng told Fox News Digital.Part of what makes females and males different is that when it comes to living longer and living healthier, different types of investments are linked to different types of gains.ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTSThe researchers hope that these findings will help women who may feel too busy or too intimidated to take on a new exercise routine without feeling that they have to compare themselves to men.They can be on their own path to success and every bit of progress will count, Cheng said.Chris Pruitt, a certified personal trainer with the American Sports and Fitness Association (ASFA) who is based in Maryland, was not involved in the study but said it aligns with observations that women and men may require different approaches to achieve similar health outcomes .In my experience, individual responses to exercise can vary widely, and its fascinating to see this backed by research, he told Fox News Digital.Biological differences between genders, including hormonal variations and body composition, likely play a significant role in these observed differences, Pruitt went on.Women may use energy or recover from exercise differently than men, leading to these distinct benefits from less exercise.5 WAYS TO STICK WITH YOUR ‘EXERCISE MORE’ NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION IN 2024, FROM A NEW YORK DOCTORThis research illustrates the importance of personalized fitness programs that consider gender differences, he said.It suggests that fitness advice should be more tailored to the individuals goals and abilities and their gender-specific physiological responses to exercise.Potential limitationsThe chief limitation of the study is that all physical activity data was self-reported — which creates the possibility for inaccuracies.In the future, direct measures of exercise could be analyzed using wearable devices , Cheng said.A very large study of people whose exercise is digitally tracked and measured could one day give us even more detailed information on differences not only between women and men, but also within women and within men.There is still a lot more work we need to do to figure out how to best tailor exercise recommendations to each individual person to best meet their individual needs.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERJosh York, founder and CEO of the New York-based fitness training company GYMGUYZ, reviewed the study and said he does not think the findings should influence peoples fitness routines.There are a lot of things you need for good health and fitness, including proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle , he told Fox News Digital.There are a lot of different variables at play when it comes to assessing a person’s exercise needs and requirements.While the study looked at maximal survival benefit, York noted that some people might be motivated by other goals, such as looking a certain way.At the end of the day, exercise doesn’t discriminate, no matter your gender, he said. You have to put the work in to be healthy. If someone puts more work in, has a healthy diet and lives in a safe environment, they are going to get better results, because physical health is influenced by your habits and mental well-being.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs each individual is different, York said that sweeping assumptions about each gender’s exercise needs and outcomes don’t take into account variations in individuals’ circumstances.I don’t think people should use this as guidance to reduce their exercise regimens, he said.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.Someone with COVID-19 might expect to experience fatigue, cold and flu symptoms , and loss of taste and smell — but a paralyzed diaphragm would likely not be on the radar.It was certainly a surprise to Gerald Branim, 55, a runner from Tennessee. His life took a drastic turn when COVID-19 damaged his lungs and diaphragm to the extent that he was unable to run or walk for a year.Branim and his doctor, Matthew Kaufman of the Institute of Advanced Reconstruction in New Jersey, joined Fox News Digital in an interview to discuss Branim’s ordeal and recovery.LARGEST-EVER COVID VACCINE STUDY LINKS SHOT TO SMALL INCREASE IN HEART AND BRAIN CONDITIONSWhen Branim got COVID in Feb. 2021, he was a fit, healthy 52-year-old who ran marathons.In spite of that, the infection caused significant lung damage. He spent two weeks in the hospital and three months out of work.For two months after leaving the hospital, Branim used a walker as he continued struggling with lung complications.For someone who had run marathons, it was quite humbling to have to walk with a walker for three months, he said.After rounds of high-dose steroids and lots of antibiotics, Branim’s chest X-rays finally showed that his lungs had cleared — but he was still having trouble functioning.LONG COVID IS HIGHEST IN THESE STATES, SAYS NEW CDC REPORTI still couldn’t go upstairs without my oxygen dropping severely, he recalled. I couldnt run 100 yards without my oxygen dropping into dangerous levels. I was severely out of breath.Thats when they started saying something else was going on — that this shouldnt be happening.I couldnt run 100 yards without my oxygen dropping into dangerous levels. I was severely out of breath.After 10 months of not being able to walk or run, Branim’s condition was finally diagnosed via a sniff test, which is also called a chest fluoroscopy or a video chest X-ray, where the patient is asked to breathe in and out.Any paralysis will show up on the scan, as the diaphragm won’t move upon breathing.What to know about diaphragm paralysisDiaphragm paralysis — which is a pretty rare condition, according to Kaufman, Branims doctor — is paralysis of the diaphragm muscle, which is the primary breathing muscle.Previous studies have estimated that the condition affects only about 1.31% of the population. In about 95% of cases, only one side is paralyzed, the doctor noted.We have two diaphragms, one on the right, one on the left, he said.In cases where both sides are paralyzed, symptoms will be much more severe, usually requiring the patient to be put on oxygen.It’s become sort of a phenomenon, Kaufman told Fox News Digital. The phrenic nerve, which is the nerve that controls the diaphragm, seems to be an area where the COVID virus can have an impact.In some ways, he said, the condition can be considered part of long COVID, which is when symptoms of the virus linger for weeks, months or even years after infection.SHOULD THE CDC DROP ITS 5-DAY COVID ISOLATION GUIDELINES? DOCTORS WEIGH INMost people with diaphragm paralysis won’t have difficulty breathing while sitting. Symptoms will typically emerge with exertion, such as walking or exercising, or when changing positions, such as lying flat in bed or bending over to tie their shoes, Kaufman said.Some people are more susceptible than others, the doctor noted.We know that viruses tend to attack nerves in the body, as we’ve seen in Bell’s palsy, he said. And now we’re seeing it with COVID causing injury to the phrenic nerve.Because the condition is rare to begin with, he said, it’s not something that’s universally known.And then you take a condition like COVID, which causes respiratory symptoms from inflammation in the airways and lungs, and then you tie in what we consider to be a neuromuscular problem, Kaufman said.A lot of times, the physician or patient will attribute it to airway inflammation, when in fact its a problem related to nerves and muscles that are part of the respiratory system.ASK A DOC: WHEN IS A COUGH SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT?In some cases, patients will recover on their own, Kaufman said.We usually recommend a period of about six to 12 months of physical therapy , breathing exercises and cardiovascular fitness to try to see if this will come back on its own, he said.If improvement is not noticed in that time frame, surgical intervention becomes a possibility.In 2020 and 2021, Kaufman said he saw an uptick of patients who experienced diaphragm paralysis after having COVID. Although he is still seeing some cases, they are starting to trail off a bit.That could be because the classic COVID is not as virulent or severe, he said. Or maybe it’s because more people are immunized.Although the condition is generally not life-threatening, it can be more severe in patients who have existing respiratory conditions.Racing toward recoveryAfter Branim’s diagnosis, his lung doctor advised him to continue to give it time to heal.But it wasn’t getting any better, he said. And I just wasnt satisfied with that being my new quality of life.WELLNESS SHOTS AT HOME CAN HELP YOU BEAT THE COLD THATS HAMPERING YOU: TRY THE RECIPEThat’s when Branim turned to Google to research surgical options. He came across an article by Kaufman, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who specializes in an area called peripheral nerve microsurgery .Kaufman specializes in conditions that cause either pain or paralysis due to nerve damage of the peripheral nervous system.After meeting with Kaufman in a telehealth visit, Branim was identified as a prime candidate for the surgery, which is called phrenic nerve reconstruction.It wasn’t getting any better — and I just wasnt satisfied with that being my new quality of life.If he had waited much longer, he said, his diaphragm muscle would have atrophied and the surgery would no longer have been possible.After a lot of back and forth with the insurance company, Branim finally got the green light to travel from Nashville to New Jersey for the procedure.The surgery went smoothly, although Branim was told that it wouldn’t be an immediate improvement. Once the nerve is fixed, the muscle still needs time to strengthen and rehabilitate.Dr. Kaufman told me that it would probably take a year or two to recover fully, and was preaching patience — but Im not a patient man in the slightest sense of the word, Branim laughed.He set a goal of running a half-marathon within a year of his surgery date.After four weeks, Branim slowly began exercising again. After six months, he decided to lace up his running shoes and give it a try.My very first run after the surgery, I ran five miles, he said. I literally cried. At that point, it was like a light switch had been flipped.MASK MANDATES RETURN TO HOSPITALS IN NYC, SEVERAL OTHER STATES AMID RISE IN COVID, FLU CASESWithin six months, Branim had not only regained his ability to run, but exceeded his original goals, culminating in a half-marathon in April 2023.In a triumphant twist, Kaufman, who is also a runner, joined his patient in completing the race in Asbury Park, New Jersey.Now, Branim aims to raise awareness about diaphragm paralysis, an often-overlooked condition that is not on most doctors’ or patients’ radars.None of my doctors had even heard of this surgery, he said. Had I not found the article about Dr. Kaufman and another runner online, I would have never been able to have the surgery — and I would absolutely not be running today.Branim emphasized the importance of patients serving as their own advocates.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTERDoctors are human — they dont know everything, he said. So you have to advocate for yourself.For patients who are experiencing shortness of breath with exertion that persists for several months, Kaufman recommends visiting a primary care physician or pulmonary physician to get the necessary testing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile most tests will find more common ailments, it definitely makes sense to keep a paralyzed diaphragm on the list of things to rule out.

She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave (1850).Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in Feb. 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? speech (1852) and Life and Times of Frederick Douglass autobiography (1881).BLACK PATRIOTISM IN US HISTORY: HERE IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTHDouglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad.Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.She personally made about 13 trips into Maryland to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to about 70 more, according to the NPS.When the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Col. James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing and cooking aid.Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor of science degree, according to History.com.ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, FEBRUARY 3, 1870, 15TH AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED, GRANTING BLACK MALES THE RIGHT TO VOTECarver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for, that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.Some of her famous written works include Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases (1893) and Mob Rule in New Orleans (1900).Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, ALBERTA KING, ‘GAVE HER ALL FOR CHRIST’He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a masters and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published books on sociology, history and politics, including Black Reconstruction in America, The Souls of Black Folk and The Talented Tenth.Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that builds Black political power to end structural racism.Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.10 FACTS ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAT ARE WELL WORTH KNOWING DURING OBSERVANCES IN FEBRUARYMarshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were separate but equal.Marshall found this doctrine flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court – where he served as a justice until 1991.Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband, Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.She earned a Congressional Gold Medal in 1991.Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.Chisholm earned a bachelors degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a masters in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, day care center director and educational consultant before entering politics.Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWSShe was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political partys nomination for president.Civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.King delivered his most famous speech, I Have a Dream, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.Kings notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott, pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery, and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.However, it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photos and video.Ruby Bridges started her civil rights work at a very young age.On Sept. 8, 1954, Bridges was born in Tylertown, Mississippi. A couple of years after her birth, her family picked up and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.When the federal court ordered Louisiana to desegregate in 1960, Bridges was the only African American to attend the all-White school, William Frantz Elementary in New Orleans.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERBridges first year in school was met with challenges.

Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.From Kings opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.Explore Kings profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.War Poverty Segregation Voting LegacyMARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY1. WarThe idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America, King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.2. PovertyDuring the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLEThe members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.3. SegregationKing fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.He famously delivered his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.Just four days after Parks arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end, he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLKS ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: WE STILL HAVE A DREAMA federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.4. VotingKing advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.Kings involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nations first Black president.5. LegacyAs King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF USWe have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But Ive come to believe were integrating into a burning house, King said. Im afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And Im afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following Kings assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he brought it on himself.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.

Be grateful for those who are around you, even if they are the family you have chosen for yourself.From laughter to animals to the beauty of nature, the gift of being alive is something for which we should all be grateful.Keep your inner circle tight and filled with love. I truly believe that love is one of the keys to making people more successful, happy and fulfilled.

Secretary-General António Guterres said there is an urgent need for dialogue between rival generals to end the conflict.The U.N. human rights office said in a new report Friday that scores of people, including children, have been subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence in the ongoinng conflict in Sudan, assaults that may amount to war crimes.Sudan plunged into chaos in mid-April when clashes erupted in the capital, Khartoum, between rival Sudanese forces — the country’s military, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and a paramilitary faction known as the Rapid Support Forces, under the command of Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.The fighting quickly spread across the African country, especially urban areas but also the restive western Darfur region, and has so far killed at least 12,000 people and sent over 8 million fleeing their homes, the report said.RASHIDA TLAIB VOTES PRESENT ON NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOTE TO CONDEMN HAMAS USE OF RAPE AS WEAPON OF WARThe report, which covers a period from the outbreak of the fighting up to Dec. 15, documents abuses in a country that has been largely inaccessible to aid groups and rights monitors recently, clouding the impact of a conflict that been overshadowed by wars in places like Gaza and Ukraine.The report found that at least 118 people had been subjected to sexual violence, including rape — with many of the assaults committed by members of the paramilitary forces, in homes and on the streets.One woman, the U.N. said, was held in a building and repeatedly gang-raped over a period of 35 days.The report also pointed to recruitment of child soldiers on both sides of the conflict.Some of these violations would amount to war crimes, said U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk, calling for prompt, thorough and independent investigations into alleged rights abuses and violations.The report is based on interview of more than 300 victims and witnesses, some conducted in neighboring Ethiopia and Chad where many Sudanese have fled, along with analysis of photographs, videos, and satellite imagery from the conflict areas.The ravages of the war, beyond the period examined, are continuing, the U.N. said.The U.N. cited video that emerged last week from the countrys North Kordofan State showing men wearing Sudanese army uniforms carrying severed heads of members of the rival paramilitary faction.ISRAELI POLICE SAY EXTREME SEXUAL VIOLENCE, RAPE BY HAMAS TERRORISTS WAS SYSTEMATICFor nearly a year now, accounts coming out of Sudan have been of death, suffering and despair, as the senseless conflict and human rights violations and abuses have persisted with no end in sight, Türk said.The guns must be silenced, and civilians must be protected, he added.Speaking from Nairobi, Kenya, by videoconference to the U.N. briefing in Geneva on Friday, Seif Magango, a regional spokesman for the U.N. human rights office said that the number of people displaced (in Sudan) has now crossed the 8 million mark, which should concern everyone.Earlier in February, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters that there is no military solution to Sudans conflict and urged the rival generals to start talking about ending the conflict. He stressed that continued fighting will not bring any solution so we must stop this as soon as possible.

The role of paternal grandparents was smaller, the study found.Grandparental characteristics associated with increased potential for providing support and decreased need of receiving support predict a lower likelihood of maternal depression, particularly among separating mothers, the researchers stated in the findings.In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, study co-author Dr. Niina Metsa-Simola mentioned that the differences in maternal mental health could be larger in the US than in Finland, particularly when mothers separate.This is because Finland is a comprehensive Nordic welfare state that offers relatively generous support measures, including affordable childcare, she said. Furthermore, multigenerational households (that is, grandparents living together with their adult children and grandchildren) are highly uncommon in Finland.Matt Lundquist, LCSW, MSED, a psychotherapist at Tribeca Therapy in New York City, was not involved in the study but reacted to the findings in an interview with Fox News Digital.In many cases, she said the most helpful form of mental health intervention is a sense of community and support from loved ones.Moms who had their own mothers living close by were less likely to be depressed.While there can be psychiatric issues that need attention from a mental health professional, often the kinds of community support, family support, caring and nurturing that new moms and new parents get is incredibly significant, he said.The support of a maternal figure who can offer woman-to-woman guidance is especially important, Lundquist noted.Women face the challenges of the change in identity that comes with new motherhood, particularly if it’s their first time giving birth, he said.And also, [they face] the challenges of learning to take care of a little baby and become a parent, Lundquist said. A lot of folks reach for support from their moms or from somebody who can be a stand-in with some wisdom and experience.ADHD IN MALES VERSUS FEMALES: WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTSIn terms of tackling postpartum depression, Lundquist said that being a new mom is an underappreciated challenge — which is where grandparents can step in.When we think about the role that [the mothers] parents play, especially her mom, theres a particular form of guidance in navigating those shifts in identity and creating space to talk about that, he said.Educational psychologist and parenting expert Dr. Michele Borba, who was not involved in the study, also emphasized that caring relationships are crucial for mental well-being.The California-based expert told Fox News Digital, [Its] little surprise that this study found that moms who had their own mothers living close by were less likely to be depressed,LOVE FROM WITHIN: 5 EASY WAYS TO CREATE FULFILLING LOVE WITHOUT DATING APPS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTSWhen living near family isnt possible, daily video calls with grandparents could be a good alternative, Borba suggested.Grandmothers can also find support networks for their daughters — friends and relatives as well as nearby medical resources, she said.The key is that the caregiver consistently reaches out in a caring, concerned manner to help the mother’s personal well-being as well as their children’s.This child-parent relationship can be instrumental in helping to ease the transition to motherhood, which can be jarring for some new moms, according to Lundquist.NAVY WIFE SURPRISES HUSBAND WITH NEWBORN GIRL DURING AIRPORT REUNION: ‘IT WAS MAGIC IN HIS EYES’There is an enormous intensity in realizing how much of yourself you have to give to someone else, said the therapist.And that’s physically, spiritually, energetically and emotionally, he said.If someone has a close relationship with their own parents, particularly their mom, thats a space where they can talk about those feelings.While single mothers seem to appreciate the support from their parents a little more, Lundquist said that for some families, its important to define the grandparents roles.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERIt seems evident that the grandparents are showing up with good intent, though they may not be as careful or nuanced in their approach as possible, he said.Lundquist suggested that grandparents offer their help rather than assuming they’re invited to visit or stay with their children and grandchildren.He encouraged grandparents to ask, What are some ways that we can be helpful but not feel like were imposing on you?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI think that has the effect of helping new moms or new parents feel more open to accepting help.

Aner Shapira, 22, along with 29 other young people in a tiny roadside bomb shelter as Hamas terrorists stormed the Supernova music festival in southern Israel.At dawn, rockets went off and armed terrorists descended upon the Negev desert from motorized paragliders.They raped women and massacred some 1,200 people in Israel that day, including 367 of the over 3,000 people who attended the festival.MOTHER OF AMERICAN HOSTAGE HELD BY HAMAS ASKS FOR GLOBAL SUPPORT TO MARK 100 DAYS OF CAPTIVITYGoldberg-Polin sent his mother, Rachel Goldberg, two text messages that morning. One said, I love you, and the other said, I’m sorry.Goldberg told Fox News Digital in a phone interview recently, He was just starting his life. We pray to God hes going to come home.Its her faith thats kept her going through the hardest of times, she revealed in a sometimes emotional interview.‘A different universeGoldberg and her husband live in Israel (they were both born and raised in Chicago). They have three children — their son Hersh was born in California. The family moved to Israel when he was nearly eight years old.Shed seen her son in Jerusalem the night before the act of terrorism, at a Shabbat dinner after synagogue, Goldberg recounted.Around 11 p.m., he kissed me, and he kissed my husband, and he said, ‘Love you guys. See you tomorrow.’She learned the grim details of what happened to her son and his friend from four survivors who were trapped beneath dead bodies in the same bomb shelter as her son.When the terrorists threw hand grenades into the shelter, Shapira heroically threw seven of them back out. But the eighth exploded in his hands — killing him.More grenades were tossed into the shelter and gunfire went off. Eighteen people were murdered in that rampage alone.Terrorists wielding machine guns then ordered Hersh Goldberg-Polin and two other wounded young men into a pickup truck outside.He was not screaming. He was obviously in shock.When Goldberg-Polin stood up, survivors reported seeing that his left arm had been blown off from the elbow down.FAR-LEFT HATRED OF JEWS TODAY ECHOES THE SOCIALISM AND ANTISEMITISM OF HITLER IN THE 1930SRachel Goldberg and her husband, Jon Polin, later saw video footage from the festival of their son getting into the truck.Goldberg told Fox News Digital, He was not screaming. He was obviously in shock. You can see that his arm is blown off … He tied some sort of bandage, with a T-shirt or something around it. He gets himself onto the truck by himself, and when he turns to sit down you can see the stump where his arm used to be.The distraught mother added, We have been living in a different universe since.The last cellphone signal from her sons phone was at 10:25 a.m. that Saturday, she said.‘Hope is mandatory’Hersh Goldberg-Polin is one of over 240 people who were abducted by Hamas, 45 of them were taken from the music festival.It is believed that as of right now, over 130 hostages are still being held in Gaza. The youngest is apparently a one-year-old baby.CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: ‘BRING THEM HOME NOW’ SAYS IT WONT REST UNTIL ALL ARE SAFELY RETURNEDRachel Goldberg is modern Orthodox. She credits her faith and her relationship with God for helping her persevere through the emotional pain, fear and uncertainty she is experiencing.God has faith in us, and gives us another chance to have another day to [create] meaning in our lives.When you’re a believer, hope is mandatory, she said.She recites the Modeh Ani prayer upon awakening to show her gratitude to God, she told Fox News Digital.Its a one-line prayer that just says, ‘Thank you for giving my life back to me, for returning my soul to me, and for having faith in me.’She added, I love that idea that God has faith in us, and gives us another chance to have another day to [create] meaning in our lives.The devoted mom reads psalms throughout the day, which she said strengthens her.I think of Psalms as a self-help book, because you can pick whichever one speaks to you in that moment.I think of Psalms as a self-help book, because you can pick whichever one speaks to you in that moment, she said.WOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES FAMILY MEMBERS IN NEW YORK CITYSome of the psalms are saying, ‘Hallelujah, youre amazing,’ and some of them are saying, ‘Im at the bottom of a pit. Where are you? Why are you hiding your face from me? Help me, help me!’Psalm 23 reminds her that God is with her, she said. Even though I’m going through the shadow of scary things, I know that youre with me, she said. Its a really great tool for people who are in the midst of something really difficult.She also summarized Psalm 121 as, I’m calling out to you from the depths.After Oct. 7, she said she has been reading a psalm each day that corresponds with the number of days her son has been held hostage.‘Don’t need two arms to travelRachel Goldbergs voice both lifted and broke as she spoke about her son to Fox News Digital.She described his humor as sarcastic without being mean, and said he always adhered to the commandment of being respectful toward his parents.Hes a voracious reader who loves music, playing soccer and camping, she said.Since the age of 15, hes been active in Hapoel Jerusalem, an organization that hosts youth coexistence activities, such as soccer games featuring Jewish and Arab kids playing together.When he was in first grade, her son asked for his subscription to National Geographic Kids to be upgraded to the regular National Geographic, she said.JEWISH STUDENTS AT GEORGETOWN LAW FEAR VIOLENCE AMID HEATED RHETORIC FROM CLASSMATES AND ANTI-ISRAELI GROUPSAlways curious about exploring different places, he traveled to six European countries for nine weeks by himself last summer, attending music festivals and meeting people from all over the world.He was planning to travel for at least another year when he was abducted, said his mother.Freeing the captives is the most important mitzvah (commandment), according to Jewish tradition, said Goldberg.She said she prays that hell get the help that he needs, that hell get the new arm that he needs — and that he will take that trip around the world, because you dont need two arms to travel, she added.Goldberg believes the hostage situation in Gaza is a global humanitarian crisis, she said, and that freeing the captives is the most important mitzvah (commandment), according to Jewish tradition.She said that even if it’s scary to get involved, theres a moment in everyones life where its time to stand up and be brave … In a crisis, thats when really who you are comes out, and its when who you are will be remembered.She and her husband came up with the idea of an educational initiative to advocate for the hostages in Gaza, and to raise awareness about how freedom from captivity is a basic universal human right for every innocent person around the globe.Everyone CountsJewish educational organizations, M²: The Institute for Experiential Jewish Education, and Kol HaOt — in partnership with The Jewish Education Project — brought this idea to life by launching the website Everyone Counts on Jan. 14, 2024 — which marked 100 days of captivity for the hostages.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ANTISEMITISM EXPOSED NEWSLETTERThe day after the site launched was Martin Luther King Jr. Day — and the Everyone Counts site displayed his quotes noting staunch support for Israel, democracy, freedom and peace that people could publicize.Photos of The Abducted Hearts exhibit in Ness Ziona, Israel, show life-size black iron silhouettes of the hostages with empty hearts cut out, illustrating the harrowing emotional effects of their captivity.The Everyone Counts site also links to other sites such as Listen to Moms — which offers support for mothers from 25 different countries who have been advocating for the release of the infants and children abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERThere are simple steps listed on the website that people can follow, such as taking one minute a day to contact their members of Congress, or wearing a yellow ribbon, a symbol of hope for freedom for the hostages.The display of this symbol in public signals to the families of hostages that their loved ones have not been forgotten.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPEvery act of advocacy can be dedicated to a particular hostage, the site also notes.No’a Gorlin, COO at M², stated, Everyone Counts is about knowing the people, and knowing each person — it’s not just some story out there.

They were trying to hold on to the walls of the hole, so it would not collapse further. The fire department said it used support boards to keep more sand from collapsing in as they used shovels to dig the children out.Sloan was pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital, while the boy was in stable condition.The girl’s mother, Therese, said via a GoFundMe post that her daughter died in a freak accident while on vacation.It took away our greatest 7.5 years. Don’t tell us you’re sorry for our loss…don’t do that to us. We experienced the purest human being and we are forever changed by her, Therese wrote.We love you beyond any stretch of the imagination. Our sweet Sloan. What we would give.One expert says that the tragedy could have been averted if the beach was staffed with lifeguards who are trained to warn people of potential hazards.This doesn’t happen on guarded beaches, Jim McCrady, a surf rescue chief in Hallandale Beach told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. McCrady is also vice president and Lifesaving Academies director for the U.S. Lifesaving Association Southeast Region.We do that all day long. We spot hazards, and then we mitigate the dangers involved in those hazards. This is a daily thing that happens on a guarded beach, when someone starts to dig a hole. We not only tell the person not to dig a deep hole, but to fill it in before they leave.NEW JERSEY BEACH SAND COLLAPSE: FIREFIGHTER DESCRIBES EFFORTS TO UNCOVER VICTIMSIn other nearby coastal towns, lifeguards are instructed to tell beachgoers about the risks of digging in the sand and to stop people from digging any deeper than about 2 feet, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, a town in Broward County about 33 miles north of Miami, does not currently staff any of its beaches with lifeguards, the publication reports.Pompano Beach Fire Rescue provides fire and ocean rescue services to the town and responded to Tuesdays incident.Lauderdale-by-the-Sea Mayor Chris Vincent said that the town commission had been considering hiring lifeguard services for its beaches this year.It’s unfortunate, maybe, we didn’t have it now, he told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. I’m not sure that would’ve saved the child’s life. I don’t want to hypothesize whether lifeguards at that time, there would’ve been a chance, I don’t know that, I don’t think anybody knows that.Henri Jean, a geological engineer, explained to Fox 13 Tampa Bay why the depth of the hole was so dangerous.For every foot you go down into the ground, you put 110 pounds per square foot of depth, so at five feet deep the amount of soil that would be on top of you would be about 550 pounds per square feet, Jean said.The combination of the weight and the lack of oxygen would result in a very bad situation for anybody down there.He said for the hole the siblings were digging to be deemed safe, it would have to be laid back with a safe slope 10 to 20 feet across at the top.Jean said that without a safe width at the top, a deep hole can quickly become very vertical and therefore, very dangerous. It is not clear how long Sloan was trapped beneath the sand.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe first thing that you can probably take from this is to never dig anything deep enough to get your head in it, Jean said.In 2022, 18-year-old Levi Caverly died when a 10-foot hole he dug with his sister on a New Jersey beach collapsed.Meanwhile, McCrady also told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that it is possible to die even if ones head is exposed, as the weight of the sand can make it too difficult for a persons lungs to expand.Additionally, the sand can pin one’s arms to their sides, making it impossible for them to pull themselves out.
376;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/todays-mortgage-rates-february-23-2024;Todays mortgage rates plummet for 30-year terms | February 23, 2024;Our goal here at Credible Operations, Inc., NMLS Number 1681276, referred to as Credible below, is to give you the tools and confidence you need to improve your finances. Although we do promote products from our partner lenders who compensate us for our services, all opinions are our own.The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.625%% as of February 22, which is 0.375 percentage points lower than yesterday.With mortgage rates changing daily, it’s a good idea to check today’s rate before applying for a loan. It’s also important to compare different lenders’ current interest rates, terms, and fees to ensure you get the best deal.Rates last updated on February 22, 2024. Rates are based on the assumptions shown here . Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).How do mortgage rates work?When you take out a mortgage loan to purchase a home, you’re borrowing money from a lender. In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your credit score , debt-to-income ratio (DTI), down payment , loan amount, and repayment term.After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an amortization schedule , which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand, and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.What determines the mortgage rate?Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income, and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:Location of the homePrice of the homeYour credit score and credit historyLoan termLoan type (e.g., conventional or FHA)Interest rate type (fixed or adjustable)Down payment amountLoan-to-value (LTV) ratioDTIOther indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:Current economic conditionsRate of inflationMarket conditionsHousing construction supply, demand, and costsConsumer spendingStock market10-year Treasury yieldsFederal Reserve policiesCurrent employment rateHow to compare mortgage ratesAlong with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:Shop around for lenders: Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees. Even if the rate is only lower by a few basis points, it could still save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.Compare several lenders to find the best rates and lowest fees.

Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:15-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.29%6.29% Monthly payment: $2,579$2,579 Total interest charges: $164,186$164,186 Total loan amount: $464,18630-year fixed-rateLoan amount: $300,000$300,000 Interest rate: 6.89%6.89% Monthly payment: $1,974$1,974 Total interest charges: $410,566$410,566 Total loan amount: $710,565Pros and cons of mortgagesIf you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:Predictable monthly payments: Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments.Fixed-rate mortgage loans come with a set interest rate that doesn’t change over the life of the loan. This means more consistent monthly payments. Potentially low interest rates: With good credit and a high down payment, you could get a competitive interest rate.

Potential rate changes: If you get an adjustable rate , the interest rate could increase.How to qualify for a mortgageRequirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:Have steady employment and income: You’ll need to provide proof of income when applying for a home loan. This may include money from your regular job, alimony, military benefits, commissions, or Social Security payments. You may also need to provide proof of at least two years’ worth of employment at your current company. Review any assets: Lenders consider your assets when deciding whether to lend you money. Common assets include money in your bank account or investment accounts. Know your DTI: Your DTI is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward your monthly debts — like installment loans, lines of credit, or rent. The lower your DTI, the better your approval odds. Check your credit score: To get the best mortgage rate possible, you’ll need to have good credit. However, each loan type has a different credit score requirement. For example, you’ll need a credit score of 580 or higher to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment. Know the property type: During the loan application process, you may need to specify whether the home you want to buy is your primary residence. Lenders often view a primary residence as less risky, so they may have more lenient requirements than if you were to get a secondary or investment property. Choose the loan type: Many types of mortgage loans exist, including conventional loans, VA loans , USDA loans , FHA loans , and jumbo loans. Consider your options and pick the best one for your needs. Prepare for upfront and closing costs: Depending on the loan type, you may need to make a down payment. The exact amount depends on the loan type and lender. A USDA loan, for example, has no minimum down payment requirement for eligible buyers. With a conventional loan, you’ll need to put down 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). You may also be responsible for paying any closing costs when signing for the loan.How to apply for a mortgageHere are the basic steps to apply for a mortgage, and what you can typically expect during the process:Choose a lender : Compare several lenders to see the types of loans they offer, their average mortgage rates, repayment terms, and fees. Also, check if they offer any down payment assistance programs or closing cost credits. Get pre-approved: Complete the pre-approval process to boost your chances of getting your dream home. You’ll need identifying documents, as well as documents verifying your employment, income, assets, and debts. Submit a formal application: Complete your chosen lender’s application process — either in person or online — and upload any required documents. Wait for the lender to process your loan: It can take some time for the lender to review your application and make a decision. In some cases, they may request additional information about your finances, assets, or liabilities. Provide this information as soon as possible to prevent delays. Complete the closing process: If approved for a loan, you’ll receive a closing disclosure with information about the loan and any closing costs. Review it, pay the down payment and closing costs, and sign the final loan documents. Some lenders have an online closing process, while others require you to go in person. If you are not approved, you can talk to your lender to get more information and determine how you can remedy any issues.How to refinance a mortgageRefinancing your mortgage lets you trade your current loan for a new one. It does not mean taking out a second loan. You will also still be responsible for making payments on the refinanced loan.You might want to refinance your mortgage if you:Want a lower interest rate or different rate typeAre looking for a shorter repayment term so you can pay off the loan soonerNeed a smaller monthly paymentWant to remove the PMI from your loanNeed to use the equity for things like home improvement or debt consolidation (cash-out refinancing)The refinancing process is similar to the process you follow for the original loan. Here are the basic steps:Choose the type of refinancing you want.Compare lenders for the best rates.Complete the application process.Wait for the lender to review your application.Provide supporting documentation (if requested).Complete the home appraisal.Proceed to closing, review the loan documents, and pay any closing costs.FAQWhat is a rate lock?Interest rates on mortgages fluctuate all the time, but a rate lock allows you to lock in your current rate for a set amount of time. This ensures you get the rate you want as you complete the homebuying process .What are mortgage points?Mortgage points are a type of prepaid interest that you can pay upfront — often as part of your closing costs — for a lower overall interest rate. This can lower your APR and monthly payments.What are closing costs?Closing costs are the fees you, as the buyer, need to pay before getting a loan. Common fees include attorney fees, home appraisal fees, origination fees , and application fees.If you’re trying to find the right mortgage rate, consider using Credible. You can use Credibles free online tool to easily compare multiple lenders and see prequalified rates in just a few minutes.

379;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/exploring-oscar-nominated-jack-fisks-legendary-production-designs;Exploring Oscar-nominated Jack Fisks legendary production designs: I like to build;Jack Fisk, the legendary production designer, has been down a lot of roads in his life. He goes looking down back roads for movie locations and hillsides on which to plop down mock houses. He’s been to the Solomon Islands for The Thin Red Line and the Canadian Rockies for The Revenant. But America, really, is his territory.Fisk, 78, has for half a century been building some of the most indelible homes and structures of movies. He crafted the grand Victorian that peers down from above the wheat fields in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978). He erected the oil derrick of Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood (2007). And he built Mollie Burkhardts Osage home for Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon.Killers of the Flower Moon, which entailed recreating the circa-1919 Oklahoma town of Fairfax, expands the wide swath of American ground, and history, that Fisk has covered. And it’s earned Fisk his third Oscar nomination, a capstone to a career crafting rough-hewn on-screen worlds with such fine-grained dimensionality that you feel as though you walked through them.KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON NAMED BEST FILM OF THE YEAR BY NY CRITICS GROUPThat’s partly because you — or at least the actors — actually could. Though much set design is done piecemeal, with a few facades just for the camera, Fisk prefers to build entire houses on location to give filmmakers and actors the ability to cross in and out of them. To see out the windows.We build everything so it can be shot from 360 degrees, Fisk said in a recent interview from his home, a 210-acre horse farm where he and his wife, Sissy Spacek, live in Albemarle County, Virginia. And directors take advantage of it. I love not narrowing down their options too early. They can move. And when the actors get involved, it’s much more organic.It’s something I’ve always liked to do just because I like to build, Fisk added, smiling.In winter, work around their house in Virginia had slowed, though Fisk had spent that morning tiling a bathroom for his daughter. Work on the house moves at a crawl, he says, compared to on set. On There Will Be Blood, he had some 50 carpenters nailing away. When you do it yourself, everything slows down to molasses, he says.Fisk first set out as a painter and sculptor. He attended art school and initially came to Hollywood only with an idea of painting billboards. After latching onto film-making, he’s helped designed all kinds of movies. Carrie (1976). Eraserhead (1977). Mulholland Drive (2001). He’s worked on nearly every Malick movie. But what he’s best known for are his homes.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhere are you going to put all these sculptures? You’re going to lug ‘em around or put ’em in a storage area, Fisk says. When I got involved in films, it was so exciting because I would build it and then they would film it. So there was a record of it. I was just as happy to never see it again. It always looks better when they filmed it. The lighting is there, the set dressing is there, the actors are performing in it. So you’re remembering it in the best possible light. Now, I build my sculptures to look like houses.

That’s up to you, of course. I would just be careful with it.Stone said consumers may assume that a fast-food company has done its due diligence or is being responsible when they serve [their food]. Some of these companies serve things that are just ridiculous and have crazy caloric intakes, and I just don’t know that we need to be doing that regularly.He said eating healthily is always about balance.CELEBRITY CHEF CURTIS STONE OPENS A POP-UP RESTAURANT FOR NETFLIXYou’ve got to make sure you keep things in balance. I think eating often throughout the day is important.

381;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/swing-state-residents-reap-benefits-biden-student-loan-handout;Swing state residents reap benefits of Biden student loan handout;More than 25,000 borrowers in six key swing states are set to have over $200 million in student loan debt canceled thanks to President Biden.The Biden-Harris administration on Friday released a state-by-state breakdown of the nearly 153,000 borrowers who will benefit from the latest round of loan cancelation under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan.When we talk about fixing a broken student loan system, this is what we’re talking about, said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The state-by-state SAVE Plan debt forgiveness numbers we’re announcing today not only show that President Biden’s leadership is making a real impact on people’s lives in every state — they demonstrate that we won’t ever stop fighting to make higher education more affordable and accessible for more Americans.This is that commitment in action. This is the real deal, the secretary said.BIDEN CANCELS $1.2 BILLION IN STUDENT DEBT SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULEThe numbers show highly-populated states, like solid-blue California, are getting the most cash. California, Texas and Florida will receive a combined $336.8 million in debt cancellation, but residents of states that are key to Bidens re-election effort will also receive substantial debt relief.The six states that may determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Former President Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 because of his surprise victories in the traditionally Democratic-leaning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden narrowly flipped those states in 2020, along with Georgia and Arizona, winning the White House by a combined 42,844 votes across three of those states.SOME STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE BOYCOTTING PAYMENTS, BUT THE RISK IS HIGH: SURVEYAccording to the Education Department, 3,990 borrowers in Arizona stand to have $33 million in debt canceled, 6,050 in Georgia will have $49.7 million in debt forgiven, and 1,990 in Wisconsin will get $13.8 million in debt relief.Student loan relief was a pillar of Bidens 2020 presidential campaign, and some progressives still say the president has fallen short by not eliminating all federal student debt.US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUPPORTS COLLEGES AND STUDENTS AMID FAFSA DELAYSIn June, the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that federal law does not allow Bidens Secretary of Education to cancel more than $430 billion in student loan debt. Biden promised at the time that his administration would continue to push for his student debt relief plan.On Wednesday, he announced that borrowers enrolled in his SAVE plan who have been in repayment for at least 10 years and hold $12,000 or less in student loan debt will have those loans canceled.

That means 99%, 99% of cyberattacks go un-prosecuted. So the cyberattacks are going to continue, he added, and somebody is dropping the ball. And in this case, its the government.Early Thursday morning, AT&T service suffered a nationwide outage most prominently impacting Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Miami service areas. A U.S. defense official told FOX News on Thursday that there was no indication it was a cyberattack.PHARMACIES SCRAMBLE TO SERVE SICK CUSTOMERS AS ‘NATION-STATE’ BLAMED FOR ONGOING CYBERATTACK OUTAGEAnd while the FBI and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said they began investigating the outages, pharmacies across the country reported delays by early Thursday afternoon to prescription orders due to a cyberattack against one of the nations largest healthcare technology companies, Change Healthcare.Change Healthcare, which handles orders and patient payments throughout the U.S., first noticed the cyber security issue affecting its networks Wednesday morning on the East Coast before disconnecting its systems.Most cyberattacks take about 280 days to trace where they are, what happened, Szabo noted. We have learned that this is likely a foreign encounter.This isnt new, the legal expert further warned. We saw Sony get hacked by North Korea. We saw the Colonial Pipeline shut down just a couple of years ago with these ransomware attacks. Were seeing ransomware attacks against our hospitals. What we need is law enforcement to go out and do its job. We need less talk, more prosecutions.Szabo recommended Americans take technological precautions to ensure their personal information is protected against a future cyberattack.Make sure you secure your personal email. Use unique passwords. Activate two-factor authentication because until the government steps up and starts doing its job, he said, we need to secure ourselves.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREAT&T apologized to customers Thursday for the outage and said it likely came from a software error. On the other hand, Change Healthcare has not given a definitive timeline for a return to service, but said outages are expected to last through Friday.This is why America needs to continue to be the leader in technological dominance in the world. We gave away our energy independence, Szabo reflected, we can not give away our technological independence.

The SEC remains committed to prosecuting such malfeasance.Loudons sentencing in the case is slated for May 17, and he could be hit with as much as five years behind bars and a maximum $250,000 fine.Also Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Loudon with insider trading in a separate civil case, which he has agreed to settle.‘GHOST GUN’ MAKER AGREES TO CEASE SALES TO MARYLAND RESIDENTS AS PART OF LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTAccording to the SECs complaint, Loudons wife was working as a mergers and acquisitions manager with BP when she was assigned to work on the international oil companys planned purchase of truck stop operator TravelCenters of America.Authorities said that Loudon bought 46,450 TravelCenters shares without his wifes knowledge over a 1.5-month period after overhearing several work conversations about the planned $1.3 billion TravelCenters takeover while she was working remotely.BP SAYS INTERIM CEO NOW PERMANENT AFTER PREDECESSOR RESIGNED FOR FAILING TO DISCLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPSTravelCenters share price rose 71% after the takeover was announced on February 16, 2023, and Loudon quickly sold his shares, authorities said.According to the SEC, Loudon stunned his wife by admitting that he had bought the shares to make enough money that she could work shorter hours.Ticker Security Last Change Change % BP BP PLC 35.38 -0.12 -0.32%BP PLCThe SEC said BP later put Loudons wife on administrative leave and then fired her despite finding no proof that she had knowingly leaked the takeover or known about her husbands trading.She moved out of the house she had shared with Loudon and began divorce proceedings last June, the SEC added.GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HEREWhen reached by FOX Business for comment, a BP spokesperson said that the company has nothing to add to what is in the DOJ and SEC documents, and it does not typically comment on personnel matters.Reuters contributed to this report.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.The state of Florida is set to crack down on life in the fast lane.The Florida legislature has passed a bill that would ban motorists from cruising in the left lane of highways, sending it to Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature. The bill passed unanimously in the state Senate 37-0.If someone in the left lane is going slower, and you pass them (on the right), you are creating an infraction, and you can get ticketed, bill sponsor state Sen. Keith Perry (R) said Thursday, according to The News Service of Florida.Under HB 317, drivers on a road, street or highway with two or more lanes where the speed limit is at least 65 miles per hour … may not operate a motor vehicle in the furthermost left-hand lane, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle, when preparing to exit … or when otherwise directed by an official traffic control device.TRAGIC FLORIDA SAND HOLE DEATH COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED: EXPERTThe restriction would not apply to high occupancy lanes.The legislation was sponsored by Republican state Reps. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Melony Bell in the House and Perry in the Senate.FLORIDA PAIR CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER SEX-FOR-HIRE CAR THEFT PLOT WENT AWRY: DEPUTIESAnyone found to be in violation of the law would face fines for a moving violation, with fines up to $158, according to the bill text.There is an exception for authorized emergency vehicles and vehicles engaged in highway maintenance or construction operations.FLORIDA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CONFIRMS 6TH CASE OF MEASLES AMID OUTBREAKPerry said the measure is intended to improve highway safety. Last year we had 247 instances where people were either incapacitated or deaths that happened from improper passing on the right-hand side on someone’s blindside, he told Action News Jax last week.Should DeSantis sign the bill, Florida would join eight other states where it is currently illegal to drive in the left lane except for turning left or passing, according to AutoInsurance.org. States with those restrictions include Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and West Virginia.Driving is a pretty uniform practice across the United States, so most of us dont think twice before crossing new state lines. However, many states have their own traffic laws that pose legal penalties and physical dangers if not obeyed, said Jeffrey Johnson, an insurance lawyer.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPVehicles in the left-lane can cause dangerous situations for other drivers when they move slower than the flow of traffic. A driver that attempts to pass someone on the right-hand side risks causing an accident by moving through the slower left-lane drivers blind spot.For that reason, 27 states require drivers to stay right if they are moving slower than the cars surrounding them.
386;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/us/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-caused-years-neglect-oversight-failures-investigators-say;Pittsburgh bridge collapse caused by years of neglect and oversight failures, investigators say;The collapse of the Forbes Avenue bridge in Pittsburgh resulted from inadequate maintenance and repair by the city, federal investigators say.The collapse occurred on Jan. 28, 2022, involving a bus and four cars.The city of Pittsburgh allegedly failed to act on maintenance recommendations for over 15 years leading up to the collapse.The city of Pittsburgh did not adequately maintain or repair a bridge and failed to act on inspection reports, leading to the corrosion of the structures steel legs and its collapse into a ravine, federal investigators said Wednesday.The city-owned Forbes Avenue bridge fell down on Jan. 28, 2022, plunging a bus and four cars about 100 feet into the Fern Hollow Creek. Another vehicle drove off the east bridge abutment and landed on its roof. There were injuries but no one died.After investigators presented their findings, three members of the National Transportation Safety Board agreed that poor inspections and insufficient oversight were among the probable causes of the collapse.PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE SPARKS CALLS TO EXAMINE MORE THAN 10K SIMILAR BRIDGESThe Fern Hollow Bridge collapse should never have happened, NTSB chair Jennifer L. Homendy said, describing the incident as a wake-up call.Homendy cited extensive corrosion to the uncoated weathering steel and repeated failures to act on damage to the bridge that was known for years. In some areas, the steel had deteriorated to the point of visible holes in the structure.The city of Pittsburgh was responsible for inspecting and maintaining the Fern Hollow bridge, said NTSB senior structural engineer Dan Walsh. Similar maintenance and repair recommendations were made in the inspection reports for more than 15 years leading up to the collapse. But the city failed to act on them, resulting in progressive corrosion to the point of failure.INVESTIGATORS IN 2022 PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE LOOKING AT DAMAGES TO THE LEGS OF THE STRUCTUREThe office of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said the administration does not dispute the NTSB findings and noted the bridge inspections were performed by consultants. The city has created a new Bridge Maintenance Division and increased funding for bridge maintenance and repairs by 300%.Pittsburgh communications director Maria Montaño said in an email that the city has since examined inspection reports for all the bridges it owns and has been working diligently to address all critical tasks identified in those reports. She said most high priority tasks have been resolved or are in the process, and the city has reviewed all of its bridges fracture critical components and made sure they are draining properly.Four people were injured, two of them severely, when the bridge collapsed just hours before President Joe Biden arrived in Pittsburgh to promote spending on infrastructure.Attorney Steve Barth, who represents bus driver Daryl Luciani in litigation against the city and engineers involved with the bridge, said the NTSB findings confirmed what his own experts had concluded.Barth said there were multiple levels of failure, from data collection, recording that data, implementation of any recommendations and then oversight.There are at least six lawsuits involving the bridge collapse, Barth said. Luciani needed shoulder surgery, had back and neck injuries and is dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, Barth said. The accident required Luciani to be out on worker’s compensation for a lengthy period, his lawyer said.Montaño declined to comment on the pending litigation.The presentations expanded on findings released by the NTSB last May, when investigators said drainage problems led to the deterioration of the structures legs and that debris, dirt and leaves had not been cleared.The old bridge was about 50 years old when it collapsed and had been under a 26-ton (24,000 kilograms) posted weight limit, with annual inspections required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since 2014. Investigators said a more accurate inspection would have reduced that to about 6,000 pounds, which may have required its closure.The board played an animation of the collapse along with video from the bus, operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, now known as Pittsburgh Regional Transit. It showed the harrowing moments when the bridge began to fail and then dropped.BIDEN SKEWERED FOR CLAIMING HE WITNESSED A PITTSBURGH BRIDGE COLLAPSE: ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER LIEThe failure began when a steel tie-plate on the bridges southwestern leg gave way because of corrosion and structural loss, said NTSB senior accident investigator Dennis Collins. The city also made improper load calculations, in part because paving records did not show the asphalt was twice as thick as inspectors believed, he said.The citys bridge inspection program did not identify all of the structures essential fracture critical sections that would require closer monitoring, Collins said.Steel cables were added to shore up the bridge in 2009, but they were intended as a temporary solution and a long-term fix was not completed.A new bridge at the site 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of downtown Pittsburgh opened to traffic in December 2022.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.Atlanta lawmakers have approved a new city ordinance banning right turns at red stoplights in certain neighborhoods.The Atlanta City Council met Monday and passed the new traffic ordinance in a vote of 10-3, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.We did it! Thank you to my colleagues for adopting my legislation prohibiting turns at red lights in central Atlanta! Councilman Jason Dozier said. Pedestrian safety and quality of life go hand in hand, and Im deeply proud of our work to make our streets safer for our most vulnerable people.The ordinance will ban right turns at red lights in Downtown Atlanta, Midtown Atlanta and the Castleberry Hill community. It will take effect at the beginning of 2026 to allow time for the citys Department of Transportation to put up signage at the affected intersections.ATLANTA OFFICIALS CONSIDERING BANNING RIGHT TURNS ON REDSupporters on the city council said the neighborhoods where right on red is now banned are home to cultural attractions, businesses and homes that bring in heavy pedestrian traffic.Officials argue the measure will make these neighborhoods safer for pedestrians and foster a sense of community, encourage social interaction, and support local businesses, therefore contributing to the overall quality of life.Dozier, who co-sponsored the legislation, previously told Fox News Digital that he proposed the ordinance because Atlanta has seen a significant rise in pedestrian injuries and fatalities due to car collisions.Weve seen a 50% increase in pedestrian deaths since 2020, and 38 pedestrians died on Atlantas streets last year as a consequence, Dozier said in an emailed statement. When cars are allowed to turn at red lights, they typically creep into crosswalks, with drivers looking only for oncoming cars rather than pedestrians or cyclists. Even worse, vehicle sizes have ballooned over the last 20 years, so even if a driver were looking for a pedestrian, bigger blind spots and narrower sight lines make it difficult to see them. Crosswalks represent some of the very little space that our cities afford pedestrians, and this legislation attempts to protect that space.TSA DIRECTOR ARRESTED BY US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTIONPropel ATL, an organization that wants to reclaim Atlantas streets for pedestrians and bicyclists, said many residents support the change.Turning right on red poses significant risks to the most vulnerable...people in wheelchairs, seniors, and people on bikes and scooters, Propel ATL Executive Director Rebecca Serna said at a January meeting, FOX 5 Atlanta reported.Opponents of the ban have raised concerns over the more than $100,000 needed to install signs at the impacted red lights and said the project will divert Department of Transportation resources from other more important projects.However, supporters say that if the red light ban is successful, it can be expanded to other parts of the city, per FOX 5 Atlanta.GEORGIA REPUBLICANS TARGET ATLANTA SQUATTERS WITH HARD-HITTING BILL: ‘NO MORE FREE RIDES’A dramatic rise in accidents killing or injuring pedestrians and bicyclists has pushed several U.S. cities to consider bans on turning right on red.The Washington, D.C. City Council in 2023 approved a right on red ban that will take effect in 2025.New Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s transition plan called for restricting right turns on red, but his administration hasn’t provided specifics.The college town of Ann Arbor, Michigan, now prohibits right turns at red lights in the downtown area.San Francisco leaders recently voted to urge their transportation agency to ban right on red across the city, and other major cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver have looked into bans as well.New York City has a longstanding prohibition on right turns at red lights, with large signs notifying drivers that they may not do the commonplace maneuver while in Manhattan.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere is no recent research on how many people nationwide are hurt or killed by right-turning drivers.Advocates for the bans and critics have pointed to a 1994 report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to Congress that analyzed four years of crash data from Indiana, Maryland and Missouri and three years of data from Illinois. The report counted 558 injury crashes and four fatalities caused by right turns on red.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
389;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/world/collapse-gold-mine-venezuela-underscores-dangers-poorly-regulated-industry;The collapse of a gold mine in Venezuela underscores the dangers of a poorly regulated industry;LA PARAGUA, Venezuela (AP) — Osvaldo Romero and his wife got off a battered boat Friday under the scorching sun of central Venezuela and walked up the bank of a river barefoot, their pants soaking wet and eyes showing the shock of having faced days earlier one of the country’s deadliest mining disasters.He carried a few belongings they had wrapped with plastic and rope, and as residents of the community of La Paragua approached him, he said he regretted having worked at the remote mine where greed and callousness were king and queen.VENEZUELA REPORTEDLY SCRAPS US DEAL TO DEPORT ILLEGAL MIGRANTS AS SOME COMMIT CRIMES TO BE DEPORTEDThat is the worst mine I have ever worked in, said Romero, who has been a miner for 10 years. He had been working at the collapsed Bulla Loca mine until Thursday, when he and his wife, without any money or gold to show for their hard work since January, hopped on the boat.They were removing the injured from the rubble, and they were still taking gold out. That’s unconscionable, he said.The collapse of the open-pit gold mine that killed at least 16 people has underscored the dangers of working in a poorly regulated industry. But it has also shown the crucial role that mining plays in the survival of thousands of people who take a gamble and create quasi-cities, complete with bingo and raffles, around mines in hopes of earning what other parts of the troubled country cannot give them.Venezuela’s government does not have an accurate count of people who were living at the site of the mine, but several miners who have worked there estimate that at least 3,000 people, including children, were in Bulla Loca at any given time since December. On Thursday, several privately operated boats arrived in La Paragua with people who had given up on their dreams of gold. Among them was a 2-week-old baby boy who was born at the mine.The community that formed around the mine includes clothing stores, restaurants, convenience stores and an evangelical church all built out of wood and tarps. Some stores also sell metered WiFi.Businesses organize bingo nights with televisions and loudspeakers as on-site prizes as well as raffles with motorcycles and cars as grand prizes that must be picked up in La Paragua. Alcohol though is banned.Food and other items are priced in gold and so are transportation costs to and from the mine. After Tuesday’s disaster, some boat operators were charging 2 grams of gold per person each way. That’s about $80, given the lower quality of Bulla Loca’s gold compared to that of other Venezuelan mines.Some of those returning to La Paragua Thursday brought back 2-liter soda bottles, bags of rice and flour and canned goods. They also brought back the shovels they used at work. Without tiny pieces of gold in their pockets, some lined up under a military tent where volunteers with a local church handed out oatmeal and cachitos, a Venezuelan savory pastry.We left out of fear and brought back nothing. Nothing, Dairely Ruiz said. We haven’t even eaten since yesterday.As Ruiz and others continued to arrive, Angel Marcano, the governor of the state of Bolivar, where the mine is located, said the number of deaths in the tragedy remained at 16, which miners and area residents consider an undercount in part because Indigenous people who lost relatives in the collapse are retrieving their bodies and burying them in their remote communities without notifying the government.Manuel Tirado, an Indigenous man of the Colibrí community, told The Associated Press he lost his son and son-in-law in the collapse. Neither was taken to a morgue or buried in the cemetery in La Paragua.I took him out of the mine and buried him in my community, Tirado said of his son Reynaldo.Venezuela’s government in 2016 established a huge mining development zone stretching across the central area of the country to supplement flagging revenue from its dominant oil industry, which has seen production decline to near its lowest levels in decades as a result of mismanagement, corruption and, more recently, U.S. sanctions.Since then, mining operations for gold, diamonds, copper and other minerals have proliferated. Many are wildcat mines, operating on the margins of the law.Despite brutal conditions and the presence of criminal gangs, ordinary Venezuelans continue to flock to mining centers in hopes of getting rich quick and escaping crushing poverty.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs he walked away from the river, Romero said he will have to sell the motorcycle and car he kept in La Paragua while he worked away to recover his losses from his two moths in Bulla Loca.But I have to thank God because I am walking even if it’s barefoot, Romero said.

The book was never published, as Azoff claimed both Eagles co-founders Don Henley and the late Glenn Frey were unhappy with Sanders emphasis on the band’s split in the early 80s.Azoff, a longtime music industry titan, admitted that Henley and Frey disliked the books direction, and that for me personally, all the stuff about the Eagles breakup was unacceptable, according to The Associated Press.Henley is expected to take the stand and testify against Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski, who were charged with conspiracy in the fourth degree for allegedly attempting to sell manuscripts, including developmental lyrics to the Eagles song Hotel California, according to the original indictment filed by the New York District Attorneys Office in 2022.EAGLES HOTEL CALIFORNIA’ CRIMINAL TRIAL OVER STOLEN LYRIC PAGES IS ‘ABOUT THE NAMES INVOLVED: ‘A GOLD MINE’The manuscripts are collectively valued at over $1 million, according to the district attorney.Defense lawyers claim Henley gave away the documents.They have accused three innocent men of a crime that never occurred, Inciardi’s lawyer, Stacey Richman, told Judge Curtis Farber during opening statements.All these lyrics are very personal to him, they’re a part of musical history, and it was simply unacceptable to him that they be stolen by anyone else, Azoff testified according to the AP. He admitted that he had never known Henley to give away any of his work, including most of the lyrics he created with Frey.3 CHARGED WITH HAVING EAGLES DON HENLEYS STOLEN HANDWRITTEN NOTES AFTER ROCK LEGEND HIMSELF GOT INVOLVED: DAWhen the biography didnt come to fruition by 1982, Azoff remembered Sanders requesting a substantial amount of money, and said Sanders had behaved with great reserve by not giving the story about the Eagles split to a magazine.He had inside knowledge, Azoff said, adding that Frey and Henley didn’t want some ugly story of the breakup of the Eagles to be published as they were both pursuing solo careers. They ended up paying Sanders roughly $75,000 so that he could find a new publisher. Sanders later sold the handwritten work to Horowitz, a rare-book dealer, for $50,000.Horowitz then sold pages to Inciardi, a former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator, and memorabilia collector Kosinski. Inciardi and Kosinski attempted to sell pages of the lyrics through Kosinskis company, Gotta Have Rock and Roll, but were caught by Henley in 2012.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

Shortly after, Inciardi sent a similar email notifying the auction house that developmental lyrics for Life in the Fast Lane were also available for sale.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERWhen Don Henley learned that Inciardi and Kosinski were trying to sell portions of the manuscripts, he filed police reports, told the defendants that the materials were stolen, and demanded the return of his property, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg Jr. said in a statement released with the charges in 2022.Rather than making any effort to ensure they actually had rightful ownership, the defendants responded by engaging in a years-long campaign to prevent Henley from recovering the manuscripts.Throughout 2015, Kosinski and Inciardi continued their attempts to sell 13 pages of developmental lyrics. In December 2016, the DA’s office executed search warrants and retrieved Henley’s stolen manuscripts from both Sotheby’s and Kosinskis New Jersey residence, according to the DA.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShortly thereafter, Horowitz attempted to exploit the recent death of founding Eagles member Glenn Frey to prevent criminal prosecution, he produced a new false statement of provenance, this time claiming that the materials originated from the now-deceased Frey, the DA shared in a statement. In one email message, Horowitz observed that ‘[Frey] alas, is dead and identifying him as the source would make this go away once and for all.’Representatives for Horowitz, Inciardi, Kosinski and Henley did not immediately respond to Fox News Digitals request for comment.

396;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/lucky-new-years-foods-around-world;10 lucky New Years foods from around the world;For many of us, a traditional New Years feast is comprised of Champagne and whatever confetti happens to fall into it while were drinking it.But for lots of revelers around the world, New Years is a time to eat symbolic (and perhaps more substantial) treats and meals.Cultures from nearly every continent celebrate the New Year with their own unique foods — many of which are eaten in the hopes of bringing luck, good health or prosperity in the near future.WHY DOES FRUITCAKE LAST SO LONG? INGREDIENTS AND PREPARATION OF THE DESSERT PLAY INTO ITS LONGEVITYSo if youre looking for a fun way to ring in the New Year that wont result in a pounding headache or confetti in your teeth, try one of the worldly delights noted below.Diving right in here.The Netherlands: OliebollenOn New Years Eve in the Netherlands, the Dutch traditionally prepare and eat oliebollen, or small doughnuts studded with dried raisins or currants.The tradition of eating oliebollen (literally oil balls) is thought to have originated with early Germanic tribes as a way to ward off the pagan goddess Perchta, who would fly through the skies during Yule and slice open the bellies of disobedient tribespeople.Anyone who had eaten oliebollen, however, was spared, as Perchtas sword would slide off their full, greasy bellies.SAY GOODBYE TO THESE HABITS HOLDING YOU BACK IN 2023Spain: 12 grapesLots of people sip some bubbly to welcome in the New Year, but in Spain (and in some parts of Latin America) theyll be gulping down the grapes themselves.The tradition of eating 12 grapes at midnight began in the 1880s as a way of copying the French tradition of having grapes and Champagne on the last day of the year, noted NPR. This custom was ultimately adopted by Madrileños, or inhabitants of Madrid, who would travel to Puerta del Sol to see the bells chime at the turning of the year and, most likely in an ironic or mocking manner, eat grapes like the upper class, the outlet said.Today, this method still lives on, and residents can even purchase their 12 grapes in small tins, already seeded and peeled.(Its also sometimes said that the grapes must be eaten within the first 12 seconds of the New Year to welcome 12 lucky months.)If luck in love is what you are looking for, its said that eating your grapes under a table could do the trick.Italy: Cotechino con LenticchieItalians know a thing or two about preparing a feast, so it only makes sense that theyd whip up a mouthwatering cotechino con lenticchie for New Years.This traditional stew is made with pork and lentils, which have been described as two of Italy’s culinary symbols of good luck.For example, some Italians believe that pigs, who push their snouts forward along the way rather than backward, are symbolic of progress. As for lentils, they’re already shaped like miniature coins, symbolizing fortune. Therefore, eating this hearty dish on New Years is said to ensure a prosperous 12 months.Berlin: Berliner PfannkuchenIn Berlin, different varieties of jelly doughnuts known as Berliner Pfannkuchen are purchased at local bakeries on Dec. 31 and enjoyed later in the evening.Some folks even eat these fluffy treats to nurse [a] hangover the next day, said The New York Times.NEW YEARS QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THESE FACTS ABOUT RINGING IN A NEW YEAR?And while the Berliner Pfannkuchen is usually filled with a fruit jam, like plum, apricot or raspberry, be warned: Its a common practical joke to fill some with mustard instead of jelly to trick unsuspecting guests, said History.com.Greece: VasilopitaWhen it comes to celebrating New Year’s Eve like the Greeks, vasilopita is the dessert you should have on the table.A piece is cut for each family member. If the coin is in your piece, you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.Greek American nutritionist Elena Paravantes describes this dish as a moist cake made with traditional ingredients like sugar, milk, eggs, and even orange and orange zest, although it can also be made with yeast for a more bread-like consistency.Vasilopita is the Greek lucky New Year’s cake that has a coin hidden in it and is cut at midnight, said Paravantes. A piece is cut for each family member. If the coin is in your piece, you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.Many vasilopitas are decorated with the date of the New Year, but they can also be topped with sliced almonds or a simple dusting of powdered sugar.Also in Greece, pomegranates have been a symbol of good luck, specifically when it comes to fertility. Often in the country, pomegranates are not consumed, but rather smashed on the ground for a stroke of good luck.If you don’t want to smash a pomegranate, there are plenty of dishes featuring the fruit you can whip together for extra luck this New Year. One idea is a yummy pomegranate-based drink, alcoholic or otherwise.In addition to pomegranates, its Greek tradition to hang onions on doors as a sign of rebirth. If you want to add some onions to your New Year’s spread in honor of this tradition, french onion soup or crispy onion rings are a good way to do so.Japan: Toshikoshi SobaOn New Year’s Eve, the Japanese savor a bowl of hearty soba noodles known as toshikoshi soba, or year-passing noodles. The buckwheat noodles are longer than usual because the soba symbolizes longevity, reported The Chicago Tribune.THE HISTORY BEHIND THE NEW YEARS EVE BALL DROP CEREMONYAccording to some historians, soba is supposed to signify strength and resiliency, since the buckwheat plant itself bounces back even after being flattened by wind and rain, added The Japan Times, which also noted that the long noodles may signify the [eaters] wish for a long life.(And if theyre feeling superstitious, some diners avoid cutting the noodles while eating to ensure lasting luck. In other words, start slurping!)American South: Black-eyed peas, Hoppin JohnIts common to see black-eyed peas on the New Years table in many parts of the American South, often as an ingredient in Hoppin John (a Carolina dish of rice, peas and bits of pork).The theories behind these dishes differ, but according to cookbook author and New York Times contributor Jessica B. Harris, the African slaves en route to America survived on black-eyed peas, and later planted the hardy crops upon arriving, so having some extra on hand at the New Year guaranteed sustenance provided by a new crop.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERAnother theory suggests that black-eyed peas came to be considered lucky sometime after the Civil War, when Union soldiers ate the rest of the Southern crops but ignored the peas, allowing the locals to sustain themselves.Black-eyed peas are often served with collard greens and cornbread.Ireland: Buttered bread (and banging bread)Irish households would sometimes leave buttered bread (or bread and butter sandwiches) on their doorsteps on New Years Eve for local children to come and collect, according to historians.The holiday is sometimes called The Day of the Buttered Bread in Gaelic.Another tradition reportedly involves banging a stale loaf of Christmas bread against the doors and walls of the house to scare away any bad spirits.Mexico: TamalesOver in Mexico, tamales are a food often served on holidays, and New Year’s is no different. When tamales are put together, the steps to make them are typically split among multiple family members. This dish is a very family-oriented one that takes help from the whole family to make.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTamales are a fairly time-consuming dish, made up of a corn-based dough stuffed with meat and other toppings, and wrapped in corn husk, so you’ll need all hands on deck.Germany: Soft pretzelsA New Year’s feast in Germany will often feature soft pretzels.These pretzels are seen as a symbol of good luck, prosperity and spiritual fulfillment, said History.com.Sauerkraut, lentil soup and fondue are usually on the menu as well.Michael Bartiromo contributed reporting.
397;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxweather.com/earth-space/intuitive-machines-nasa-return-america-to-moon-landing;Watch live: NASA, Intuitive Machines provide update on Moon landing;NASA and Intuitive Machines are scheduled to provide an update at 5 p.m. ET Friday on the first American spacecraft to land on the Moon in more than a half-century. Watch the event live in the video player above.America returned to the Moon on Thursday with the Odysseus lander touching down near the unexplored region of the lunar South Pole.While about half of all lunar landings end in failure, Houston-based Intuitive Machines is the first private company to succeed, also marking the first U.S. Moon landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972. This was the first successful mission as part of NASAs Commercial Lunar Services Payload (CLPS) program. Another commercial lunar mission by Pittsburgh company Astrobotic failed to reach the Moon last month.The Nova-C lunar lander arrived near the Moon’s South Pole on Thursday at 6:23 p.m. ET. Flight controllers confirmed that Odysseus was upright and sending data two hours later, following communications troubleshooting.Odysseus is alive and well, Intuitive Machines said Friday morning on social media. Flight controllers are communicating and commanding the vehicle to download science data.The company said the lander has good telemetry and solar charging as they continue to learn more about the vehicle’s specific location and overall health.Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus will speak to the media at 5 p.m. ET Friday to discuss more on their historic moment.We can confirm without a doubt our equipment is on the surface of the Moon, Intuitive Machines Chief Technology Officer Tim Crain said.Intuitive Machines teams had to think on their feet as the landing approached.The lasers on the spacecraft needed for landing were not functioning but Intuitive Machines engineers opted to complete another orbit for landing and allow time to upload a patch reworking the landing system to use two lasers on NASA payloads.The quick thinking paid off.During its descent phase, the spacecraft guided itself to the landing area known as Malapert using the Terrain Relative Navigation camera from Redwire Space. The high-definition camera looked for a safe landing spot free of craters, boulders and other hazards. At 10 meters (about 33 feet), the spacecraft locked in on its landing site.The hazardous landing required Odysseus to slow from about 4,000 mph to a velocity of about 2 mph (1 meter per second) before touching down on the Moon.Odysseus has a new home, the private space company stated after the landing.Thursdays landing came just a week after SpaceX launched the Nova-C spacecraft known as Odysseus from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Where is Odysseus on the Moon now?The Odysseus lander was expected to touch down about 186 miles (about 300 kilometers) from the lunar South Pole in an area known as Malapert, named after the 17th-century Belgian astronomer Charles Malapert. The area is near the lunar mountain Malapert Massif, one of NASAs lunar landing candidate sites for the Artemis III astronaut mission.NASA and the greater space exploration industry are interested in the unexplored region of the lunar South Pole because it likely contains water ice, which can be mined for fuel and other resources. NASA paid the company $118 million to shuttle its payloads to the shadowed region.If all systems are working, Intuitive Machines expects to provide power for its payloads for about a week before lunar night on the South Pole.NASA CLPS Program Manager Chris Culbert told FOX Weather the six NASA payloads on the Odysseus lander will help future human missions to the South Pole.We have a radiation sensor that will help us measure what radiation looks like at the South Pole of the Moon, Culbert said. That helps us prepare for future human missions to that location.Another NASA instrument will measure how Moondust behaves near this region.A retroreflector, a little device that we can bounce laser signals off of that tells us exactly where the lander is on the Moon, Culbert said of the palm-sized reflective object.All of this is geared to helping us learn more about the environment and prepare for future human missions to the South Pole, Culbert said.In the coming years, more than a dozen other CLPS missions will launch NASA science to the Moon.

But by next week is going to dive right down the coast of Canada into the Pacific Northwest, ultimately turning into a low-pressure region that will be north of the Rockies.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPThis graphic shows the snow potential in the mountains across the western U.S. next week.(FOX Weather)The FOX Forecast Center said the storm will be colder, which will cause snow levels to drop and allow snowfall to pile up across the western mountain chains in the U.S.This is especially beneficial in the Northwest and will be the most significant storm since January. The snowpack there is hovering around 50% of the average, so the snow expected from this storm could boost that.More rain is also expected in California, and although the rain amounts are expected to be much lower than what the state just experienced from a multiday atmospheric river storm this past week, there will be a threat of additional landslides and mudslides because the ground is so saturated.The FOX Forecast Center said high winds are also expected across the interior West behind some cold fronts moving through the region on Monday and Tuesday.DRIVING ON THE ICE AND DRIVING IN THE SNOW: WEATHER DRIVING TIPS FOR DRIVING IN INCLEMENT WEATHERThis graphic shows the cross-country storm in the Midwest and moving into the Great Lakes region starting Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024.(FOX Weather)It’s going to be a deep trough, which means it’s going to be just stacked up across the atmosphere, Van Dillen said. That allows for moisture and heat to come off the Gulf of Mexico.That will set the stage for the possibility of the development of severe thunderstorms on Tuesday and Wednesday.ADVICE FOR DEALING WITH STORM ANXIETY WHEN SEVERE WEATHER THREATENSChicago, St. Louis at risk of severe weather TuesdayNOAA’s Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has already highlighted areas of concern on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week that have the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms to develop.This graphic shows the severe weather risk on Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2024.(FOX Weather)The end of February is usually where we have a better chance of seeing an atmospheric setup that would produce a lot of severe weather, FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin said. So the timing, you know, not all that shocking. We’ll see how things hash out for next week.More than 21 million people from Chicago and Aurora in Illinois through St. Louis in the Midwest and into Little Rock in Arkansas and Tulsa in Oklahoma have been placed under a Level 2 out of 5 on the SPC’s 5-point severe thunderstorm risk scale.WATCH VS. WARNING: HERE ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE WEATHER TERMS THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFEWednesday severe weather risk shifts to Indianapolis, Columbus, NashvilleThis graphic shows the severe weather risk on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024.(FOX Weather)The severe weather threat shifts and expands by Wednesday and includes more than 30 million people from the Mississippi Valley and Southeast into the Ohio Valley.The SPC has placed cities such as Indianapolis, Columbus in Ohio, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and St. Louis in a Level 2 out of 5 risk on Wednesday.When we have these day four, day five outlooks through the Storm Prediction Center, they usually end up getting a little more aggressive with their language as we get closer, Merwin said. And this is a setup we’ve been talking about behind the scenes for a little bit of time now.WHY DOES THE SKY SOMETIMES TURN GREEN DURING THUNDERSTORMS?This graphic shows the progression of the cross-country storm impacting the East Coast by the end of the week.(FOX Weather)And as the cross-country storm continues to move off to the east, there could be another area of concern for severe weather, but the SPC hasn’t issued such an outlook as of Thursday.The system will then reach the East Coast by later in the week.

Meanwhile, this afternoon, were concerned with severe weather across South Carolina and also parts of North Carolina.DOWNLOAD THE FREE FOX WEATHER APPA look at the forecast in the East on Friday.(FOX Weather)A lack of cold air keeps snow relegated to northern New England, where generally less than 1 inch is expected. Across Maine totals will be slightly greater, in the 1-3 inch range.Light accumulations for upstate New York, parts of Massachusetts and northern New England, Merwin said. That opportunity really finishes up by lunchtime, with the exception of the state of Maine.A look at the snow forecast in the Northeast through Saturday.(FOX Weather)The rain will be the most prevalent south of our nations capital with cities like Richmond, Norfolk, Raleigh, Charlotte and Columbia staying wet for much of the day, the FOX Forecast Center said.7 FACTS ABOUT RAINRain is in the forecast through Friday in the East.(FOX Weather)A few stronger storms will be possible during the afternoon and early evening over parts of South Carolina into southeast North Carolina.Theres definitely the potential that between 2 p.m. to about 6 p.m., we got thunderstorms for South Carolina that could produce some hail and maybe some gusty winds, Merwin said. Past that, everything is offshore.The rain and snow will move offshore Friday evening and cooler air will be ushered in its wake.When is the next big storm?Arctic outbreaks look highly unlikely as we wrap up meteorological winter at the end of the month, the FOX Forecast Center said.The collision of cold and warm air masses helps spawn big, sprawling systems. While it is likely that we will still be tracking something next week, there will be few ingredients with which to work for any storm. This is unlikely to bring significant winter weather outside the various mountain ranges of the West and Rockies.

404;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/world/imprisoned-former-pakistani-pm-imran-khan-addresses-imf-election-audit-push;Imprisoned former Pakistani PM Imran Khan addresses IMF in election audit push;Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan is writing a letter to the International Monetary Fund urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of the countrys recent election, which his party alleges was rigged, his party said Friday.Senator Ali Zafar, a top leader from Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party or PTI made his televised remarks after meeting with Khan at the Adiala prison, where he is serving multiple prison sentences.The latest development comes days before the IMF is to release a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan.PAKISTANS EX-PREMIER KHANS RIVALS NAME SHEHBAZ SHARIF AS CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTERIt also comes a day after IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said the global lender was ready to work with Pakistans new government on policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and prosperity for all of Pakistan’s citizens.The IMF has not commented about Khans much-publicized move to write them a letter.Khan has come under severe criticism at home from his rivals who claim Khan tried to block a tranche of $1 billion from the IMF to Pakistan to harm the country’s economy.Pakistan narrowly averted a default on foreign payments last summer when the IMF approved the much-awaited $3 billion bailout for it following monthslong talks with former premier Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after his ouster in a no-confidence vote in parliament in 2022.Sharif is currently in talks with his allies to form a coalition government as no party, including the candidates of Khan, could get a majority in the Feb. 8 vote.Though Khan’s candidates won 93 out of 265 National Assembly seats in the elections, it was not enough to form a government. Khans party says it has evidence that officials changed the election results in dozens of constituencies to convert the victories of its candidates into defeat, a charge the election oversight denies.The PTI candidates who were winning (in the elections) were defeated because of rigging the vote, Zafar said, adding that Khan wants the IMF to call for an independent audit of the elections before it continues talks on the release of loans for Pakistan.The IMF and Khans former government have been at odds since the former premier did not fully comply with a 2019 agreement under which he got a $6 billion bailout. The release of a key tranche from that bailout remained on hold, causing a sudden increase in inflation and a devaluation of Pakistans currency against the U.S. dollar.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSharif, who is set to become the countrys new prime minister, has said he will negotiate another bailout with the IMF in an effort to combat inflation and improve the countrys ailing economy, which is the biggest challenge he faces.
405;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/world/london-police-confirm-body-pulled-thames-river-chemical-attack-suspect;London police confirm body pulled from Thames River is chemical attack suspect;London police confirmed Friday that a body they pulled from the River Thames is that of Abdul Ezedi, a man wanted over a chemical attack that injured his former partner and her two young daughters.The Metropolitan Police said his body was formally identified on Thursday and that his family has been informed of this development. The force also said that a post-mortem has confirmed his cause of death as drowning.UK POLICE REPORTEDLY PULL BODY OF SUSPECT IN CORROSIVE SUBSTANCE ATTACK FROM RIVERAs the public would expect, our enquiries continue into this atrocious attack, said Commander Jon Savell. The 31-year-old woman is still in hospital and remains in a stable condition and no longer sedated. We have still not been able to speak to her but hope to as soon as she is well enough.Police launched a nationwide manhunt for Ezedi after the attack in the Clapham area of south London on Jan. 31 that saw the mother-of-two doused with a corrosive alkali. Some of the chemical injured her 8-year-old daughter, while the 3-year-old had her head slammed into the ground.Images of Ezedi soon after showed he had significant injuries to the right side of his face, but his whereabouts were unknown. On Feb. 9, the Met said they believed Ezedi had probably gone into the water after piecing together closed-circuit television footage of his movements after the attack.The Met said the crew of a passing boat reported seeing a body in the water near the Tower of London on Monday afternoon and that they believed it was Ezedi.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBritish media reported that Ezedi is an Afghan refugee who was granted asylum despite being convicted of a sex offense in Britain in 2018. His asylum application was initially rejected, but he later was permitted to remain in the U.K. after claiming that he had converted to Christianity, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.
406;Fox News;https://www.foxnews.com/;http://www.foxnews.com/world/extraditions-sought-theft-600k-south-african-president;Extraditions sought in theft of $600K from South African president;Prosecutors said Friday they are seeking extradition orders and the arrest of more suspects over the 2020 theft of around $580,000 in U.S. cash that was hidden in a couch at South African President Cyril Ramaphosas ranch.The theft, which only became public in 2022, engulfed Ramaphosa in scandal and led to an investigation by financial authorities. He was cleared of wrongdoing, although he also faced an impeachment vote in Parliament over it. He survived the vote because of his ruling African National Congress partys majority.Ramaphosa was accused by political opponents of tax evasion and money laundering over the money hidden at his Phala Phala game ranch in the northern province of Limpopo. The fact that the cash was stashed in a couch raised questions over whether Ramaphosa had properly declared the foreign currency.SOUTH AFRICA SCHEDULES ELECTION AS MANDELAS PARTY FIGHTS TO RETAIN 30-YEAR MAJORITYRamaphosa said the money came from the sale of buffalos and denied any wrongdoing.Two men and a woman have been arrested and charged with the theft. Prosecutor Nkhetheni Munyai said at a hearing Friday in the northern town of Bela-Bela that an extradition process had begun to bring other suspects to South Africa. He didnt say how many suspects or where they would be extradited from.Reports at the time of the scandal said suspects in the robbery had escaped to neighboring Namibia.The scandal badly damaged Ramaphosas image after he was largely elected in 2019 on a promise to clean up corruption in the ANC-led government. He reportedly nearly resigned over the matter.Ramaphosa will seek a second and final five-year term in a national election on May 29, when the ANC is expected to face the sternest test in 30 years of governing Africas most advanced economy. Several polls have the ANC slipping below 50% of the vote for the first time in a national election, which would force it into a coalition to stay in government.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe ANC is due to launch its election manifesto on Saturday at a sports stadium in the eastern city of Durban.

But don’t worry, you’ll be paying for this, too.I’m Tomi Lahren, more next.Joe Biden announced he is forgiving 1.2 billion in debt for roughly 153,000 borrowers.But, of course, we know that Joe himself won’t be paying or forgiving anything, you, the American taxpayer will foot this bill.Joe attempted to forgive a lot more, but the Supreme Court stood in his way. This is his “workaround.”Through the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, those who took out less than $12 grand can have their debt FORGIVEN after 10 years of payments.Again, there is no such thing as “forgiving” or “cancelling” debt into thin air.This just means the American taxpayer will absorb that cost, including those who already repaid their own loans and those who never went to college or took out loans to begin with.This “student loan forgiveness” push is just a way for Joe and Democrats to garner favor with young voters.In reality, what it is teaching borrowers is that the commitment made can be broken if the president needs votes.The entitlement generation is loving this, hardworking folks, do not.I’m Tomi Lahren and you watch my show “Tomi Lahren is Fearless” at Outkick.com

But Will The Dems Kick Him Off The Ticket?;Host of the “Kennedy Saves The World” podcast Kennedy joins Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla to talk about the possibility President Biden gets booted off the 2024 Democratic ticket by his own party.“Joe Biden has lost Bill Maher, Jon Stewart, The New York Times, Ezra Klein and all of these, you know, liberal stalwarts who had always protected the Democrat establishment. So, you know, we are reaching critical mass. We are getting past what I call the event horizon, which is the point in the black hole from which you cannot escape. And Biden is losing these people at such a clip. They are now no longer talking about who, but when and the when is more important now than the who, because that will be determined at the convention. So, Ezra Klein has crafted, this big fantasy that they’re going to at the convention, Biden will step aside. He will be forced aside because a demented person who’s power hungry is not going to let that icy, bony grip go anytime soon. So they think that the delegates that were once pledged to Biden through the primary process are going to go to whoever is most deserving and, you know, let the chips fall where they may. But that’s going to piss off a lot of voters who went through the charade. That was the primary process where, you know, this poor, senile guy who, through elder abuse and greed, is being kept in power. They voted for him on the promise that you know, him running unopposed was somehow a good idea. “Jimmy and Kennedy also kick around whether or not VP Kamala Harris’ will still be President Biden’s running mate if he remains the candidate.

And what the RNC should do is they should explain to their voters this is how you vote in 2024 and things have changed. Accept it. And if you really want to win, you better, but you better play by all the rules, not just yours. “

Clem, the former Chief Patrol Agent of the U.S. Border Patrol in Yuma, AZ, joined the Guy Benson Show today to discuss the latest from the southern border of the United States. Chris Clem discussed his experience with being a border patrol agent for nearly 28 years on the southern border. Clem and Benson also discussed the current numbers of illegal crossings on the southern border, and the pair compared the current border crisis to previous administration’s respective borders. Listen to the full interview below.Full Interview:Listen to the full podcast:Full transcript:Guy Benson I’m Guy Benson. We’re back here on the Guy Benson show. We are in South Texas today. The McAllen area at the border, as we’ve been teasing for another program at Ground Zero, or at least one of the many ground zeroes of this crisis that we talk about on a regular basis, basically daily on this program. And I’m very pleased to welcome into the show here in studio with me, Chris Clem. He’s the former chief patrol agent of the US Border Patrol in Yuma, Arizona. Although he’s moved all across the region, he knows what he’s talking about. Chief, it is great to meet you earlier today and to have you here on the program.Chris Clem Appreciate it. It’s great to meet you. And, what a great visit we’ve had so far.Guy Benson Yeah, seeing a lot, learning a lot. And, you know, you come to the border once or twice if you’re like, okay, I got a handle on it. And then you go to a slightly different part of the border. The topography changes, the challenges change. This is one of the themes that you keep talking about. If you’ve been to even one part of one sector, that’s it. It does not apply those same lessons necessarily to other parts of the border. Before we get into all of that, just for the benefit of our audience, if you wouldn’t mind just running through your career, you were 27 plus years in the Border Patrol, starting as a trainee at the very bottom, then all the way up to sector chief. Just quickly tell us about that journey, just for your expertise and the sure, the credibility you bring to this conversation right now.Chris Clem It was a great career. I started off as a as a young GS five Border Patrol trainee in Lordsburg, New Mexico, down there in the Boot Hill of New Mexico. Now, I’m from New Orleans, originally grew up in Houston. So for a city guy to go out to the desert. But I fell in love with it. You know, I loved being out there. Back in those days, in the early part of my career, it was mainly Mexican nationals, seasonal workers and drug mules. That’s who we were going after. Smuggling cases, things like. It was so much fun, you know, the, the chase was better than the catch sometimes, right? You were tracking all day long. You catch them and they’re like, well, now we got a process, right? So, so much fun.Guy Benson When was that?Chris Clem That was in the in the late 1990s. I came in in 1995 under the the Clinton administration. I moved around, promoted up to a senior position out in West Texas. I worked in Sierra Blanca, which was then part of the Marfa sector. It was mainly a checkpoint stage, but it was wide open terrain. So if I wasn’t working checkpoint, we were tracking tracking groups for miles, sometimes days to to catch them. Then I went back to New Mexico as a supervisor, and promoted up the ranks and began, commander, we called the patrol agent charge, of a station in New Mexico. Then I moved to, back to El Paso area command of the station there. Then I went to Arizona in 2010, and I was the patrol agent charged the Casa Grande station. And it’s important to talk about that because that was the busiest station in the nation in 2010. Tucson sector was was just crazy with with, migrant traffic, drug running. And it was all happening right there in Costa County. So I really earned my stripes, the years I was there in Casa Grande that got me up to Washington, DC, where I had oversight of, of operations, mainly Texas. And then, I became the deputy chief of the New Orleans sector. So a, a a little bit different dynamic of dealing with off the border, but yet, coastal operations and interior operations. And that ultimately got me back to Arizona and then to El Paso as the deputy chief. I was the number two for the El Paso was checking.Guy Benson Off a lot of states.Chris Clem Here. Yeah, yeah. So I’ve covered all of the southwest border, the, the yeah, the Gulf Coast and then Washington DC. The only place I didn’t work as an agent was the northern border. And, and I became a deputy chief in the senior executive, service, and, and El Paso was ground zero for a while. And in thousand and 18, 19, it was it was crazy. In El Paso, we were seeing thousands a day coming in there. It was it was, awesome. I had a short stint as an acting chief and Big Ben and then got the permanent position in Yuma. And I spent, a couple of years as the chief in Yuma. But I lived away from my wife and children, and, and I had, I had done my time and thought, you know what? You know it. Now it’s time to get out, because I wasn’t, like, in the direction that, this administration was taking. I expected some changes, but I didn’t expect this complete upheaval of what was probably the best border security apparatus we had in place in my career, and have it completely turn away. I had my time in I had 27 plus years, and, I was ready to retire.Guy Benson You were.Chris Clem Eligible? Eligible? So.Guy Benson Yeah, I was out of here. I wasn’t.Chris Clem Forced out. I was actually encouraged to stick around, by, by those at the headquarters level. But I thought what’s best for me and my family was for me to go ahead and retire.Guy Benson And that was 2022.Chris Clem Yes. December 31st, 2022. So I’ve been retired just over a year and a month. It’s been a great year and a month for me.Guy Benson So one question before we get into the current crisis in the current policy. You were talking about how different areas, even in different states, ended up becoming the hot spots of any given six month stretch or two years or whatever it is. And it’s New Mexico, it’s Arizona, it’s this part of Texas. Why do certain areas get hot all of a sudden? Is that just the cartels saying we’re going to flood that zone for a while?Chris Clem What? That’s exactly what it is. I mean, you go back to right before I came in, all the all the hot spots were California. I mean, that’s where, you know, Operation Gatekeeper started in the early 90s. That’s where the first infrastructure, the double layer fencing, all the, cameras. And, I mean, that’s where we kind of learned the model of what the right system is. That was an early 90s. We kind of replicated that in El Paso.Guy Benson That’s a pretty small, relatively speaking. Yeah. Chunk of border it is.Chris Clem California only has about 60, 70 miles of really international border where it’s intense. Maybe a little bit further. But back to your question. Yes. Currently in the way it’s always been is the, is the cartels control the flow of what comes into the country is when we’re talking about illegal entry. Some of that has to do with infighting within the cartels. Who’s going to, control one area? But, but, yeah, they see our chasing the soccer ball mentality that the federal government does about. Oh, well, there’s a problem here. Let’s shove everything over there. So what do they do that is run someplace else? So instead of having this consistent plan that we’ve had, this administration essentially just kind of follows the soccer ball and the cartels use that.Guy Benson That reminds me of a point that we were just talking about earlier on our way over here. And I think it’s important for people to really understand at home. And it’s something that I did not until I came here in 22, probably around the time you were getting out. Yeah, I came down here for the first time to really look at it. I did not appreciate how sophisticated the cartels are, the scope of this operation. It’s not just, you know, a couple guys paying off some coyotes and, like, get some drugs in there if you can. This is a multi multi-billion dollar operation and it’s run by people who might be really bad, but they’re also really smart. And the stuff that we’re doing on this side of the border and our government saying, doing, etc., they pay attention to all of it and they adjust accordingly, right? I mean, that’s just the reality, you know?Chris Clem Absolutely. So they’re definitely have a business model and very business savvy, right? They pay attention, especially as we are in election years and election cycles of what the rhetoric is. You know, if this person gets in, you know, it’s going to be harder. So let’s let’s start recruiting heavily right now. But the cartel is commodity neutral and they don’t care as long as they can make money. And they have realized that smuggling people, trafficking people is a win win business for them because they get most of the money up front. And the smugglers nowadays do not cross the border with the migrants that they’re smuggling. Back in the day, we would catch the smugglers, you know, walking and guiding a group or driving a group across the border. Now everything’s done online. Everything’s done, you know, through cell phones. They’ve made arrangements, they’ve paid some money upfront, or they’re going to pay money when they get to their location. The cartels have their tentacles all over the world. And so think about this. If they were running drugs, they would have to manufacture the drugs, cross the drugs, get the drugs to the end user and get the money and the proceeds back. All right. When you’re moving people, all you gotta do is get them to the border. And guess what? In this model and the way our government has responded is, well, we’ll just take everybody that gives up. Yeah, we’ll.Guy Benson Finish the process for.Chris Clem Them. And again, that’s another quote from former Secretary Jay Johnson. The U.S. government is completing the smuggling cycle. And basically that’s what we’re doing.Guy Benson All right. So our guest here on the Guy Benson show from the border today is Chief Chris Clem, who’s just recently retired from Border Patrol career agent here. When we come back, since you have now invoked Jay Johnson, we quoted him on this show. This is the former DHS secretary under Obama. That number that he gave a thousand people crossing a day would be overwhelming. He said that’d be a crisis level. Well, we know, especially these last few years, been blowing past that on a regular basis. I want to talk about what that looks like. Sort of nitty gritty day to day, what it’s like for people in your position for 27 years and just try to put it into perspective over more than a quarter century of your experience, how bad it is today compared to even not that long ago. So that’s all to come. Chris Clem is with us here in studio at the border. I’m here with the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. Delighted to be here bringing you this information on the Guy Benson Show. Fascinating conversation continues right after this. America is listening to the Guy Benson show. We are halfway through today’s program here on the Guy Benson Show. Guy Benson show.com is our website. The podcast is free as soon as the show is over. We’re broadcasting from Q RV, Am 710 here in McAllen, Texas, right at the border. I was actually south of the wall earlier today. Not technically in Mexico, because the border wall actually is a little bit inland, so to speak, in certain places. But we were south of the wall, right up against the river, and seeing with our own eyes this crisis that has gotten so much worse. As you all know, within the last three years under this administration, with me here in studio is Chief Chris Clem. He was the border chief, the station chief, the sector chief, I should say, in Yuma, Arizona, and had a long career leading up to that. So let’s put things into perspective, chief. You have seen through your career certain areas and you talked about this were okay. The crossings are really intense right now. Let’s put resources there. Let’s deal with that. The numbers, though, in the last three years. We talk about them here on the program a lot. It’s like people’s eyes glaze over. They are so huge. The magnitude of the crisis is unlike anything that we’ve seen. You’re a boots on the ground guy. Try to contextualize it from your perspective.Chris Clem Yeah. So we had I started in 1995, as I mentioned, President Clinton. Every administration had leaned forward on border security. We were building wall, we were building infrastructure. We were adding personnel, strong policies. And it really kickstarted a lot under under President Trump where, you know, we had some challenges getting started. But once it started, you know, working we were building wall, we had access road, we had the technology. And the numbers started showing that especially with some of the policies like the Romania, Mexico or the Migrant Protection protocol, third party asylum agreements and you guys all know the numbers and I’ll round up a little bit. But I think in 2019 we had 900, just over 900,000 arrests with one. That dropped to just over 400,000 in 2020. We got a new administration. There’s executive actions and executive orders ending wall construction, by the way. So everybody knows the wall was just one piece of the puzzle. It was wall cameras, sensors, access, road and policy. He ended all of that. Biden. Biden did within the first hours and days of his administration. In fiscal year 21, those apprehensions went to 1.66 million. 22. It went up to like 2.4 million and then 23. If you play the nuance game between CBP and Border Patrol, it was still 2.4 million people, and we had over half a million gateways into those three years. So there’s close to nine plus million, almost 10 million people that we know of that have come in legally under this administration, close.Guy Benson To 2 million of whom we got away with no idea who they are, where.Chris Clem They are. Absolutely. And so that that goes back to the kind of the premise of the question when we had this system, this wall system, those requirements were identified by Border Patrol agents saying, this is what we need in the sector. Repeating thing. We’ve talked about this drip. If you’re you mentioned earlier, if you’ve seen one sector, you’ve seen one sector like we saw today, the river bending in Rio Grande Valley. I mean, you would you would need ten cameras to cover one mile. We’re out in the desert in Arizona. One camera could cover ten miles. So you can’t take this one size, that all approach. That’s why the border is complex. It’s dynamic. And the cartels know that. And they know that the federal government is typically slow to respond with, especially with big resources. So when they see attention going in one area, it’s easy for them to shift and go someplace else. Yeah, yeah.Guy Benson Jay Johnson, who ran DHS under President Obama, was certainly at the time criticized by conservatives and border hawks. By comparison, looking back, he was a hawk himself relative to the current team and the current administration. No doubt about that. You were telling a story earlier about how the crisis during the Obama administration, about unaccompanied minors and family units, how that was treated, how that was reacted to by the Obama administration versus numbers that are way higher now under Biden. Tell us a bit about that.Chris Clem Yeah, I will say this. And we invoke Jay Johnson. But it was very pragmatic in his thinking. He was solution and results oriented. I like the man as a secretary. Obviously when you see him testify, it’s kabuki theater up there. Any way you know that when you’re doing that. But when it came down to problems and looking for solutions, that military background, that military prosecutor mindset was there and I appreciated his attempts. So what we’re talking about is it was actually that leading up to Mother’s Day week in 2014, we were seeing just a huge influx.Guy Benson A decade.Chris Clem Ago. Yeah, a decade ago, under Obama and Vice President Biden. I think that’s important for people to know. It’s the same leadership, if you will. Leading up to Mother’s Day weekend, Rio Grande Valley, specifically, the McAllen station, was seeing a huge increase of unaccompanied children and families. And it was, I mean, literally hundreds of them. And we had we have no border Patrol stations were built for single adult men or short term holding, not care and process of children. That’s actually, by law, the responsibility to help and human services. So it’s overwhelmed. And we told the department on that Friday, they wanted to just wait for the Mother’s Day weekend. Let’s talk about it on Monday. We said, no, no, no. If you wait, you’re gonna have a full blown crisis. Actually, Jay Johnson and his wife diverted their trip and came down to McAllen. There’s a there’s a picture where he’s looking at all these children with the the mylar blankets. And he’s like. And he went back to Washington the very next day and basically issued a secretarial proclamation, which got all the DHS resources to say, hey, we’ve got an unaccompanied child price crisis. And later that week, the president, President Obama, made a proclamation say, hey, we’re going to take a full court press and we’re going to divert resources. And so we demanded, like health and Human Services to step up and open shelters.Guy Benson We just when the kids in cages.Chris Clem Yes. And by the way, that’s when we built the kids in cages. We built the cages here in McAllen. The first ones were built, an old warehouse. We had so many people, we had to get them out of brutal concrete holding cells. So the best thing you do with a warehouse for safety and security, both the migrants and the agents, is you use chain link divide and so we can see through it. So no one’s being assaulted or abused.Guy Benson It was actually the images were kind of twisted.Chris Clem Yeah, absolutely. That’s what they do. Right. That it was about the narrative.Guy Benson And and they blame that on Trump even though it started under Obama, which is just an interesting footnote. But I think the more important story here, although the kids in cages optics, I think does matter. The origin story there, the way that the Obama administration, for all their faults, said this is a real problem.Chris Clem Yes.Guy Benson Compare that to what we’re seeing now and over the last three years, because it has totally dwarfed anything that you were seeing a decade ago.Chris Clem Yeah. And I think a lot of the Border Patrol agents who, you know, were in the patrol during that time are seeing that same lot of familiar names in the administration now going, well, wait a second. What changed ten years ago, ten years ago, this was a crisis. Now you won’t even utter the words crisis. Now it’s a challenge. Ten years ago, you were doing a full court press to stop things. Now you’re seeing how quickly can you process and release people? It’s very frustrating and that, you know, and that’s what I think is kind of a big problem for. Or the border security, you know, enforcement agents. Right. We had support to to detain and remove. But I think to which is important is to give, you know, give context and credit. Remember, between Obama’s first term and second term, there was a big push for comprehensive immigration. And the conservatives said, we want border security. The, the administration said, well, we want comprehensive immigration. So they said, if you secure the border, we’ll give you the reform. So there was a reason for the Obama administration to work very hard at securing the border. And this unaccompanied children and the family that’s ever come in that was looking bad. So he had to fix.Guy Benson That, jeopardizing his other political goals.Chris Clem Right, right. And ultimately, it came down to semantics what the definition of a control is. Apparently we still hear that because we hear the border is secure, the border is closed, but we witness it every day that it’s not to the extent that it needs to be. Yeah. Not even close.Guy Benson Because Johnson was saying a thousand day is overwhelming. Just two months ago, in December, it was more than 10,000 a day on average.Chris Clem Right, right. Yeah. So think about this. And this is kind of funny. And I’m glad we’re talking about it. When I was in Yuma, in October, right before I got there in October 2020, we averaged 25 people an arrest. Those were good of.Guy Benson The sector.Chris Clem In the sector.Guy Benson 25 a day.Chris Clem That’s it. That’s fun. That’s that’s. Agents are having a blast. So November happens. We had an election. It went up to 34. All right. Not a big increase. No big deal. December it was close to 50 a day. January it was around 70 today. By May it was 500 day, and by the end of the year we average a thousand a day.Guy Benson Oh my goodness.Chris Clem And I only had.Guy Benson To hold on, hold on, hold on. Let’s just it was before the election and right around the election, 25 a day. Yes. And within months it was a thousand a day.Chris Clem Yes.Guy Benson In your sector that you that you controlled.Chris Clem That’s right. So when you look at I was coming and going, this is going to be awesome, right. This is going to be a great chief fun time being a Border Patrol chief. Do we have no support? The policies have been taken away. They stopped building the wall. And by the way, to include myself. And as chief, you’re not out there tracking and catching and processing every day. Now, that would be a luxury. We had just over 900 agents. You divide that across five stations, multiple shifts, days off. I mean, you’re looking at a on a fat day for us would be maybe 150 agents catching a thousand people a day. And that was one sector. And that’s why it is so important that we have to look, take a complete holistic approach, look at every sector challenges, every sector’s requirements. And that’s how we focus on getting this.Guy Benson Because like the one size fits all top down thing from DC doesn’t really work in a lot of cases. I want to talk about the recently killed Senate bill, what can be done coming up in the next segment. But very quickly, before we go to break two stories, number one, we were talking about non-governmental organizations, NGOs, Catholic Charities and others. I understand in my heart that there are people who want to do good and want to help, and these are human beings coming across, and you don’t want anyone to starve or not have water or what have you. There also seems to be an element, though, with some of these NGOs where they are perpetuating the crisis almost as part of a business model. I know that sounds a little cynical. Maybe, but in your experience, is that true? Are you seeing groups that maybe say that they mean well, and maybe they do mean well? Ultimately, the money is flowing into their coffers from the feds or whomever to deal with the crisis that they are incentivized to kind of keep going. Is that too cynical?Chris Clem No, no, it’s not cynical. I think it’s it’s very real. First of all, any law enforcement, whether you’re a Border Patrol agent or a domestic police officer, if you don’t put the well-being of human beings, first and foremost, you probably shouldn’t be doing this job. So, we’re all in this to take care of people, right? And we just do it, by securing the border and do a humanitarian response. The non-government organizations in many areas, especially where I was, Newman stepped up. They basically changed their business model to protect the community because the the numbers were so enormous for, you know, like Yuma that the food shelters, the domestic violence shelters, all of that would contribute to the citizenry. We’re taking all the resources to support the migrants. And so you had that NGO step up and say, hey, we’re going to help, but then you have some other ones, right, that are, you know, again, I don’t want a broad brush, but I will say that there are quite a few that are have some really big international connections and coffers and are in some of these source countries that we have seen that they are giving maps out and giving aid and encouraging the route of travel.Guy Benson Giving migrants maps to get here.Chris Clem Yes. And they’re they’re directly and indirectly connected to some of the non-government organizations here. And so that that is not I mean, that’s fact. We’ve seen the reports.Guy Benson And one of the objections to that Senate bill was that it would further empower and fund some of these NGOs, which a lot of people view as at least to some extent, part of the problem in certain respects.Chris Clem Well, they’re all getting they’re all getting paid, reimbursed, dollar for dollar from FEMA for every migrant that they take and help.Guy Benson You replenish the money and top it up even more. Then, you know, the incentives speak for themselves very quickly. You left in 2022. You said you were encouraged by some people at Border Patrol to stay. I don’t think DHS in Washington would have wanted you to stay. You were telling about how Secretary Mayorkas would kind of send little minders down to try to really prevent you from giving interviews, and for a while they did, and then they wanted to sit in the room during interviews, they would tell TV stations, well, he didn’t mean that. Change this. We want you to use the DHS secretary’s talking points. That seems to be extremely inappropriate from a law enforcement perspective, but maybe it makes sense from a political narrative perspective, if that’s what the priority might be up there in.Chris Clem DC, as we mentioned, their their priority was secure in their narrative, not the border. I, I did not have an adversarial relationship with Secretary my orcas and, it was kind of like the, the sheepdog and the wolf. Right. Good morning, Ralph Morton. Sam. And then they would, when we were in the room or talk about policies, we we would have disagreements, but we were professional and respectful. But I used to get frustrated when we finally got to be able to speak our mind and tell the facts. And, look, I, I was a career employee. I knew where the line was. I wasn’t going to cross it. But the facts are the story. And, and so, yeah, we’ve had I had a few of those kind of contentious host interview conversations with people. Well, you.Guy Benson Didn’t want you sharing the facts with the.Chris Clem Public, right? Absolutely. That’s it. Yeah. That’s what it come down to. You know, that’s not what we want. That’s not the message we want. But eventually, because I am true to myself and had maintain the integrity, I kept, the forward momentum and and they pretty much did. Well, we’ll let them continue to do that because not doing it became the narrative. If all of a sudden you, you gag me and shut down my social media and all that kind of stuff, people would notice. Yeah, would say, hey, why isn’t he talking? Why can’t we interview anymore?Guy Benson Well, we’re interviewing him right now. Chris Clem was the sector chief in Yuma, Arizona, at the tail end of a 27 year plus career with Border Patrol. We are here at the border in McAllen, Texas, from the studios of Q, RV, Am 710. And when we come back, I do want to ask you about maybe quickly, some thoughts on real solutions that could work on the Guy Benson show. Next, it’s the Guy Benson Show partnering with Americans for Prosperity Foundation from the border today. Thank you for tuning in. Our guest for really most of this hour. Fascinating. Chris Clem, who was in Border Patrol for 27 years. He ended up as a sector chief in Arizona. But as we talked about two segments ago, he’s been all over this border. He knows what he’s talking about. Which brings me to political solutions. There was this Senate bill that died recently. I ended up being against it, but not sort of in a super heated way. I just ultimately didn’t trust the Biden administration to enforce anything that they don’t want to. There were other components of it that concerned me. People almost forget that H.R. two was passed by the House. That is the Republican bill that has gone absolutely nowhere. Of course, in the Democrat held Senate, there was Brandon Judd, for example, came out in favor of the Senate bill. He came on this show and said, here’s how it would improve things dramatically in these eight ways. He said, it’s not perfect. Well, it’s a moot point. It’s not going anywhere. But what do you think could actually realistically work between the Senate bill, the House bill, the president that happens to be in office right now, the vice president’s border czar. As you look at this, how would you sort of cobble together something that at least would be a dramatic improvement?Chris Clem Yeah. I was disappointed that Senate bill, and, because it projected the numbers of when they were going to act, it basically presupposes that when it got to a number, we could we could actually do something. That that telegraphs, hey, 4000 a day. Once that hits that number, then we’re going to do something. Well. Here’s my problem with that is, as I mentioned, in a place like Yuma, if you send 1200 a day for 2 or 3 days, we’re completely swamped. But that would. But that would never trigger the the president’s actions to take further action. So you’re going to go ahead and drown one section and leave it wide open to the cartel because it meets your threshold. So I couldn’t stand that part of the Senate bill.Guy Benson Well, and also it’s like they said, well, if we get to this threshold, then we’ll do all these things. Which tells me you can do all those things.Chris Clem Absolutely. The only thing, the only thing I found that was important that I liked in the Senate bill was the Ice detention, because they are the necessary piece of consequences. What was also important, and I confess I didn’t read the whole bill, but it’s really what wasn’t in the bill. It did say mandatory detention for single adults. How long? Because you know it. You get three parties in high school. You’re going to get mandatory detention for three hours. So how long are those single adults going to stay in there? Is it really going to be a consequence? So maybe a short term solution give a little breathing room. And that’s maybe why Brandon Judd was in favor of that. But it didn’t have a long term security piece, which is why I like H.R. two, because it starts off right off the bat. The first 3 or 4, contents on the table is border security reinforced. Finish building the wall. Support the, the ports, back ice it somewhere between that piece and the Senate piece. Maybe we can find some common ground.Guy Benson In between somewhere there. Because border enforcement, lasting enforcement, credibility restoration has to come first before any of this other stuff. That’s where I come down on it. Chris Clem, longtime Border Patrol agent and he was sector chief in Yuma, Arizona, here on the ground with us at the border in McAllen, Texas, on the Guy Benson Show. Chief, what a pleasure to have you here and to meet you.Chris Clem A pleasure to meet you. Thank you for having me. And look forward to, maybe talking again.Guy Benson Final hour of the Guy Benson show coming up next. We have some other fantastic guests here in studio as well. You don’t want to miss that. Straight ahead.

I don’t think she’s even the third choice. I think if something were to happen to Donald Trump to make him, you know, ineligible or unable to run, which I don’t think is going to happen, by the way, I will. Yeah, man. Whatever. Give up. Truly, I don’t know. He would he wouldn’t. But if something crazy were to happen, the second choice has always been Ron DeSantis. It is never been Nikki Haley, at least on the Republican side. So her little game of being a buzzard waiting in the wings for something to happen.

Who wants to pay those taxes to live in a state overrun by crime and homelessness?This is not only bad for the state of California, but a very bad look for Governor Newsom who has, no doubt in my mind, been running a shadow campaign to replace Joe as the Democratic nominee.Clean up on aisle 5, Gavin!

Her “announcement” was that she plans to stay in the race and in Donald Trump’s way until the bitter end.She is not able to do this because she has the support or the delegates or the numbers to put on the board, but simply because she is well-funded by the uniparty establishment.Nikki Haley is the special interest candidate of all special interest candidates and her staying in the race is not only a waste of resources, but a big help to the Democrats.She is circling around Trump like a buzzard hoping something will happen to him but apparently she hasn’t interacted with REPUBLICAN voters enough to realize she isn’t even the second choice!Nikki, you are as full of YOURSELF as you are full of IT!I’m Tomi Lahren and you watch my show “Tomi Lahren is Fearless” at Outkick.com

Benjamin Hall, senior FOX News correspondent and host of the podcast “Searching for Heroes with Benjamin Hall,” joins the Rundown to explain the current state of affairs in Russia, why Navalny’s demise has sparked international outrage, and discuss the war in Ukraine as it approaches two years since Russia invaded.As the workplace begins to look younger and younger, with Gen Z employees set to soon overtake Baby Boomers in the workforce, concerns persist about where office culture is heading. A viral trend has emerged recently of “Zoomers” filming themselves getting laid off, and posting them on TikTok. This along with remote work demands have employers worried for the future generation of workers. Co-host of The Big Money Show on FOX Business, Taylor Riggs, joins the podcast to discuss Gen Z’s workplace etiquette, how artificial intelligence is impacting the world of business, and touches upon inflation’s impact on consumer spending.Plus, commentary from host of OutKick’s Tomi Lahren is Fearless, Tomi Lahren.Photo Credits: Associated Press
