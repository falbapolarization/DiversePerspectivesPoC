To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.Barry Tubb appeared in the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun, but he didnt act in the 2022 sequel, Top Gun: Maverick.Now, Tubb is suing Paramount Pictures, the production company behind both films, for using a behind-the-scenes image of him from the first film in the later release. According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Tubb is seeking unspecified damages for the unauthorized use of his likeness.In the case, filed Wednesday, Tubbs lawyers said that when the actor played the role of Lt. j.g. Henry Wolfman Ruth in Top Gun, he signed a contract agreeing for his likeness to be used only in the original film.‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ STAR TOM CRUISE ADMITS HE ‘CRIED’ OVER ‘EMOTIONAL’ REUNION WITH CO-STAR VAL KILMERAt the time, movie sequels were virtually nonexistent, so the possibility of expanding the contract to include the use of his image in any future projects wasnt discussed. Despite that fact, the documents state Paramount used the image without seeking his permission and without compensation.The image in question is a photo of the fictional Top Gun Class of 1986, along with U.S. Navy pilots who acted as consultants during filming. It was altered to be used in the movie.‘TOP GUN: MAVERICK’ PRODUCER JERRY BRUCKHEIMER SAYS ‘NOBODY WORKS HARDER’ THAN TOM CRUISEIn the scene in Top Gun: Maverick, the camera zooms in on the photo to show Tubb with Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards, the other principal members of the cast. According to Tubbs case, his likeness used in that scene is essential in a way that is not incidental.The argument is that Paramount used Tubbs image for commercial gain — the documents note that Top Gun: Maverick was massively successful at the box office — without asking him or offering him compensation. His legal team also argues that his right to privacy was violated.LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
